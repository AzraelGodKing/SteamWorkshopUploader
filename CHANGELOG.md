# Changelog

## 2.0.0

Modwright's uploader becomes its own app: **Steam Workshop Uploader**.

- **Only the uploader.** The Drop Pod (the mod manager for RimWorld and Sun Haven players) is gone, along with its
  command line (`droppod ...`), the taskbar's Play entries and the first-start choice of sides. Everything for
  uploading stays, for any game with a Steam Workshop.
- **RimWorld stays fully supported:** the RimWorld layout, About.xml checks and editor, adding a game version, the XML
  patch check, clean-colony tests, Play it live, the compatibility grid and reading a player's log. RimWorld is found
  through Steam, or you pick its folder the first time a tool needs it.
- **Its own name and place,** so it installs beside Modwright without either touching the other: the program is
  `SteamWorkshopUploader.exe` (also on the command line), settings live in `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader`,
  scheduled uploads in Task Scheduler's "Steam Workshop Uploader" folder, and updates come from this repository.
  Settings from Modwright are not read; Options > About > Import settings takes a Modwright export.

## 1.17.0

- **A new theme: PlusBacon.** Options > Appearance > Theme now also offers PlusBacon: teal (#069494) on black, with
  the teal on buttons, ticks and selected rows and a lighter teal for links and the "wright" in the app name.

## 1.16.1

Under the hood; nothing you use changes.

- **Click-through tests:** CI now starts the real app (portable, with a fake RimWorld and Sun Haven) and clicks
  through The Drop Pod the way a player would: activating a needed mod, saving to the game, switching to Sun Haven.
- The main window's code is split into smaller files by area, so changes are easier to review.

## 1.16.0

The Drop Pod learns a second game: Sun Haven.

- **Pick the game** at the top of The Drop Pod: RimWorld or Sun Haven. The choice is remembered.
- **Sun Haven mods** are the BepInEx plugins in `BepInEx\plugins`, folders and loose DLLs alike, with names and
  versions from Thunderstore's manifest.json or the plugin itself. Unticking a mod and pressing Save to game moves it
  to `BepInEx\plugins-disabled` (where mod managers keep switched-off plugins); ticking moves it back.
- **Missing dependencies from Thunderstore:** Download missing gets them (and what they need) into
  `BepInEx\plugins\Author-Name`, laid out like r2modman does, without touching your config files.
- **Updates from Thunderstore:** Check for updates lists plugins with a newer version; the ticked ones are updated
  with the old copy zipped first.
- Modlists, share codes, Compare with a friend, Find the broken mod, notes, history, Play, Test and Read the log work
  for Sun Haven too. RimWorld-only tools (instances, saves, Insight, Workshop and texture tools) are hidden for it.
- The command line takes `--game SunHaven`.

## 1.15.0

Lighter textures, leaner packages and a safety net for your settings.

- **Optimize textures** (The Drop Pod > Tools): pick active mods and each PNG texture gets a DDS beside it, which
  RimWorld 1.5 and later load instead: quicker to load and far smaller in video memory, which matters most with big
  texture mods. The PNGs are never changed, DDS files a mod ships itself are left alone, textures a mod updates are
  converted again, and Undo removes the DDS files Modwright made. The encoder is built in; nothing is downloaded.
- **See where a package's size goes.** The package view (right-click a mod > Package > Preview package) says which folders
  hold most of it, sorts the files by size when you click Size, and lists what players rarely need (source art such as
  .psd and .blend, debug files, a Source folder, tool folders).
- **Leave those out of every package** in one click. The patterns are saved in the mods folder's `.steamhelper.json`
  (built-in layouts keep them too) and apply to git packaging as well as folder copies.
- **Daily settings backups.** Once a day when Modwright starts, the settings, upload history and the Drop Pod's
  modlists, notes and load-order history are copied (the newest 14 are kept). **Options > About > Your data > Restore a
  backup** puts one back, keeping the current ones first.
- **Export settings takes the Drop Pod along:** modlists, notes and load-order history now travel to another PC too.

## 1.14.0

The Drop Pod for players with big mod lists: mods Steam keeps up to date, drag and drop, quicker rescans, updates
from GitHub and a command line.

- **Missing mods are subscribed through Steam.** Download missing, Use this save's mods and loading a Steam collection
  now subscribe to the Workshop items through the Steam client when it is running, so Steam downloads them and keeps
  them up to date. Without Steam running, SteamCMD downloads them into the Mods folder as before.
- **Turn downloaded copies into subscriptions** (Tools): Workshop mods SteamCMD put in the Mods folder, which never
  update by themselves, are subscribed through Steam, and each copy goes to the Recycle Bin once Steam has its own.
  The mod list doesn't change.
- **Drag mods to reorder them.** Drag one or several selected mods to a new place in the load order; a line shows
  where they land, the list scrolls at its edges, and Ctrl+Z undoes it. Dragging an inactive mod into the list
  activates it there.
- **Rescans are much quicker with big libraries.** Mods whose About folder hasn't changed aren't read again: with
  1,500 mods a rescan takes a tenth of the first read.
- **Updates for mods from GitHub.** Check for updates also asks GitHub about Mods folder mods whose About.xml links a
  GitHub repository. Newer releases are listed, and the ticked ones are downloaded and put in place, with the old copy
  zipped into Modwright's mod-backups folder first. Git working copies and linked folders are never touched.
- **The Drop Pod on the command line:** `SteamCmdHelper droppod lists | instances | active | problems | switch
  <modlist> | play [<modlist>]`, each with `--instance <name>`, and `--json` for scripts. Handy for desktop shortcuts
  or Steam launch entries per setup; `problems` exits with 1 when there are errors.

## 1.13.0

XML clashes: what goes wrong between mods when they change the same game data, for players and for mod authors.

- **The Drop Pod's Insight finds XML clashes.** It loads every active mod's Defs and Patches the way RimWorld does
  (respecting loadFolders.xml, MayRequire, FindMod and Conditional patches) and says where two mods change the same
  thing: a mod that replaces another mod's def outright, a patch that overwrites or removes what another mod's patch
  changed, and which one wins because it loads later.
- **Patches that will fail are named before you start the game.** Insight lists each mod's patches that find nothing
  to change (the red "patch operation failed" errors in the log), and XML files that aren't valid.
- **Mods that rewrite many of the game's own defs** are pointed out, since other mods' changes to those may not stick.
- **The Launch Pad checks your patches before upload.** With RimWorld found, the upload confirmation runs your mod with
  only the game, the DLC and its dependencies, and warns about patches that find nothing (players would get red errors)
  and defs it takes over from a dependency.
- **More RimWorld checks before upload, no game needed:** a def defined twice in the same mod, a texPath into the mod's
  own Textures folders with no texture there (a pink square in game), and English Keyed texts nothing in the mod's
  code or XML mentions.
## 1.12.0

- **A new theme: Hunter.** Options > Appearance > Theme now also offers Hunter: black with silver for ticks, selected
  rows and button text. Red stays a small touch, on the one main button of each window and the "wright" in the app
  name, so it never takes over.

## 1.11.0

A polish pass on what is already there: smoother and quicker, with nothing new to learn.

- **The Drop Pod's details panel no longer stutters.** Each mod's preview image is now read in the background and kept
  at the size the panel shows, so moving through a long mod list stays smooth and Modwright no longer holds hundreds of
  full-size pictures in memory. The Launch Pad's details panel works the same way.
- **No flicker in the mod lists.** They are drawn off-screen first, so scrolling, resizing and picking rows look clean.
- **Filter boxes keep up with your typing.** The list is filtered once you pause instead of on every key, which matters
  with hundreds of RimWorld mods. Esc now clears The Drop Pod's filter too, and Enter filters at once.
- **The details panel doesn't blink.** Moving between mods with the arrow keys no longer flashes the "nothing selected"
  summary in between.
- **Ctrl+F works in The Drop Pod**, going to its filter instead of jumping to The Launch Pad.
- **Modwright opens on the side you used last** when you use both The Drop Pod and The Launch Pad.
- **Esc closes Find the broken mod** and puts your mod list back, like its button does.
- **Fewer disk reads while drawing.** The Launch Pad's preview thumbnails no longer check the file every time a row is
  drawn.
- **Closing Modwright no longer loses Drop Pod changes.** With a mod list that isn't saved to the game, closing asks
  whether to save it first (or cancel), instead of dropping the changes without a word.
- **Save and start in one click.** Play or Test with unsaved changes now offers to save them and start, start with the
  game's current list, or cancel.
- **Ctrl+S saves The Drop Pod's mod list to the game.**
- **Ticking and moving mods in The Drop Pod is quicker.** The count of mods that aren't installed no longer looks
  every mod up again for each active one, and your load-order rules file is read again only when it changes.
- **Moving a mod up or down doesn't redraw the list.** The two rows swap where they are, so holding Alt+Down walks a
  mod down smoothly.
- **The Drop Pod list keeps its place.** Undo, sorting and reading the mods again no longer scroll back to the top.
- **Tooltips stay long enough to read.** They used to vanish after 5 seconds; now they stay while the mouse rests.
- **Esc in Options goes back** to The Launch Pad or The Drop Pod, wherever you came from.
- **The keyboard shortcuts list (F1) is up to date.** It uses the tabs' current names and adds The Drop Pod's keys
  (Alt+Up and Alt+Down, Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+S) and Esc in Options.

## 1.10.0

- **Three more themes: Triphlx, Tohma and Skywolf.** Options > Appearance > Theme now also offers Triphlx (true black
  with an electric blue), Tohma (deep royal blue with crimson) and Skywolf (black with a deep dark purple). Triphlx puts
  dark text on its blue, and Tohma and Skywolf white text on their crimson and purple, so buttons and selected rows stay
  easy to read.

## 1.9.0

- **Six new themes: Koneko, Serina, Wolfie, Vickra, Kitomi and Szendoo.** Options > Appearance > Theme now also offers
  Koneko (near-black with a bright purple), Serina (deep purple with mint green), Wolfie (deep blue with a bright
  green), Vickra (jewel tones: deep emerald with a bright sapphire), Kitomi (black and white with a bold red and cyan)
  and Szendoo (dim grey with hot pink). Like Kats, each picks the text colour that reads best on its bright colour so
  buttons and selected rows stay easy to read, and the brand bar follows the theme's own colours.

## 1.8.0

- **The uploader is now The Launch Pad.** In RimWorld, a pod launcher fires transport pods that land as drop pods, so
  mods take off from The Launch Pad and land in The Drop Pod. The tab, the brand bar, the window title and the
  first-start choice use the new name; nothing about uploading changes.
- **Use it as a mod manager, a mod uploader, or both.** The first start asks what Modwright is for: the mod manager (The
  Drop Pod), the mod uploader, or both. Only what is picked is shown; the other tab, its Options sections, shortcuts and
  command palette entries are hidden. Change it any time under Options > Appearance, live and without reinstalling.
  Anyone already using Modwright keeps both, so updating asks nothing.
- **Modwright reads as one word in the brand bar.** "Mod" and "wright" keep their own colours but no longer have a
  gap between them.
- **The Drop Pod shows the picked mod beside the list**: its preview, author, version, where it comes from, what it
  needs and what needs it, which modlists use it, your note on it and its description, with buttons for its folder,
  Workshop page and change notes. Drag the divider to resize it.
- **Undo and a load order history.** Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y undo and redo changes to the mod list, and every Save to game is
  kept (Tools > Load order history) with what was added, removed and moved, so you can go back to the list from
  before last night's change.
- **Why is this mod here?** Right-click a mod to see which rules (needs, loadAfter, loadBefore, your own rules file)
  put it where it is in the load order.
- **Find the broken mod for me.** Tools > Find the broken mod halves the suspects each round, starts the game with one
  half (always with what they need), and asks whether the problem is still there. It names the culprit in a few rounds
  and puts your list back at the end.
- **Steam collections and a friend's list.** Load a Steam collection as a modlist (nested collections too), and
  compare your list with a friend's share code: what each side has that the other doesn't, the order and versions,
  with Make mine match.
- **Your own notes and colours on mods**, shown in new Tag and Note columns and in the details panel.
- **Clean up unused mods and settings.** Lists Workshop mods no modlist, instance or save uses, and settings files of
  mods that are gone, with their size. The ticked ones go to the Recycle Bin, and Workshop mods are unsubscribed.
- **Modlists with their mod settings.** Export the active mods with their settings files as a .zip, and import one to
  get the same list and settings. New instances start with your mod settings.
- **What changed in an update.** After Check for updates, the change notes of the mods with updates are shown, with
  lines that mention saves, breaking changes or removals marked.
- **A save backup before a risky start.** When the list differs from the mods your newest save was made with, the
  Drop Pod offers to copy the save first (turn it off under Tools).
- **Load times.** Each start is timed from the game's log, so Tools > Load times shows how long each setup took, how
  much slower or faster than last time, and which mods were added since.
- **Launch options** for the normal game and for each instance (such as -quicktest or -popupwindow), with options that
  clash with the Drop Pod's own named.
- **Freeze an instance.** Its Workshop mods are copied into the instance so Steam updates can't change them, and are
  linked in only while that instance plays. Updates waiting on Steam are listed when you unfreeze it.
- **Start RimWorld from the taskbar.** Right-click Modwright on the taskbar for Play RimWorld and each instance.
- **Report a mod's error to its author** from the log window: a ready bug report (the error, the game version and how
  many mods were active) opens on the mod's GitHub issues or its Workshop comments.
- **Test in a clean colony** (The Launch Pad, right-click > RimWorld): your mod starts with only the game, the DLC and
  what it needs, in its own instance and straight into a test map. When you close the game its log is read for errors
  that point at your mod. The upload confirmation then warns when the mod has errors or changed since its test, and a
  dependency update suggests testing again.
- **Play it live.** Links your mod's folder into RimWorld's Mods folder, so each build is in the game with nothing
  copied. Only links Modwright made are ever removed.
- **Read a player's log.** Paste a log, a pastebin/gist/hastebin link or a file a player sent, and see only the
  problems that point at your own mods, plus the mod list the log carries.
- **An About.xml editor** with the Drop Pod's checks shown live as you type. Needs, loadAfter, loadBefore and
  incompatibleWith can be picked from your installed mods, so packageIds and Workshop links are right. Fields it
  doesn't show, comments and by-version lists stay as they were.
- **A compatibility grid**: each of your mods' last clean-colony result on each RimWorld version it supports.
- **A version bump hint.** The version dialog marks the bump your commits since the last upload point to (major for
  "BREAKING CHANGE" or "feat!:", minor for "feat:" or "Add ...", patch for the rest), and the upload confirmation
  warns when the version looks too small for them.
- **Subscriber milestones and drops.** The log notes when a mod passes 1,000 (or another round number) subscribers, and
  when it lost a noticeable share in a week.
- **A release checklist** per mods folder (Options > Uploading): your own steps, shown as boxes to tick in the upload
  confirmation. Turn on "Don't upload until every step is ticked" to make it a must.
- **Make a preview image**: a title card over a screenshot or a colour, at 16:9 for RimWorld or square, saved as the
  mod's preview (the old one is kept) and shrunk under Steam's 1 MB if needed.
- **Workshop description from README**: turns README.md into Steam BBCode (headings, lists, links, images, code,
  quotes) in the mod's description file, with a preview first.
- **Release a mod family together.** When picked mods need each other, the ones others need go up first, and when one
  fails, the mods that need it are not uploaded, so players never get half a release.

## 1.7.0

- **SteamCMD Helper is now Modwright**, with two sides: the Workshop uploader and the Drop Pod for RimWorld players.
  The name in the window, the brand bar (which also says which side is open) and the messages changed; the program
  file, the settings folder and the download page stay the same, so updates and settings carry on. The Drop Pod's
  buttons and lists are translated into German, Russian and Simplified Chinese.
- **The Drop Pod: a new tab for the RimWorld mods you play with.** It finds RimWorld through your Steam libraries (or a
  folder you pick), reads every mod from the base game and DLC, the Mods folder and the Workshop, and lists each one's
  name, author, package ID, where it came from, the game versions it supports and its place in the current load order.
  Mods with a broken About.xml show in the warning colour with what is wrong, mods made for another game version are
  greyed out, and package IDs installed twice are named at the top. Ctrl+Tab now steps through Upload, Drop Pod and
  Options.
- **The Drop Pod sorts and saves your load order.** Tick mods to make them active, move them with Up and Down
  (Alt+Up/Down), and Sort orders them so each loads after what it needs and its loadAfter list and before its
  loadBefore list (the version-specific lists for your game version included), with the base game and DLC first.
  Where no rule decides it keeps your order, or goes A to Z. Mods whose rules go round in a loop are named instead of
  silently dropped. Save to game writes ModsConfig.xml, keeping the old one as a backup, and refuses while RimWorld is
  running (it would overwrite the list when it closes). You can add your own rules file (More > Use my own load-order
  rules file) to put mods after or before others, or first or last; nothing is bundled.
- **The Drop Pod finds problems before you start the game.** Under the mod list it shows, errors first: mods that need
  a mod that isn't installed or isn't active, needed mods that load too late, rules the order breaks, two active mods
  that say they don't work together (in their About.xml or your rules file), mods for another game version, list
  entries that aren't installed, a package ID installed twice (and which copy the game uses), and broken About.xml
  files. Double-click one to find its mod. Activate needed mods ticks the installed ones that are missing from the list,
  each before the first mod that needs it. Download missing gets the missing ones that link a Workshop item with
  SteamCMD and your saved login, straight into RimWorld's Mods folder (an older copy is only replaced once the new one
  is complete). Check for updates asks Steam which installed Workshop mods have a newer version, and which are no
  longer public.
- **Modlists.** Save the active mods as a named modlist and switch between them in one click. Export one to a file,
  import a file (also RimWorld's own saved .rml lists), or share it as a single line of text that starts with
  DROPPOD1: and paste one in. Mods a list names that aren't installed are listed when you switch.
- **A closer look at About.xml before uploading.** Besides a missing or malformed packageId, the RimWorld check now
  warns when About.xml has no name, author, description or supportedVersions, when a version is written as "1.5.4104"
  instead of "1.5", when a dependency has no packageId, no Workshop or download link, or an id RimWorld can't use, and
  when loadAfter, loadBefore or incompatibleWith name the mod itself, something that isn't a packageId, a mod that is
  also a dependency, or the same mod both before and after. Options > Uploading can make these warnings block the
  upload too, and the new `SteamCmdHelper lint` command runs every check without uploading (`--strict` for the same
  rule). The check reads About.xml with the same parser as the Drop Pod.
- **A new Kats theme, and the theme is now a drop-down.** Options > Appearance lists Dark, Light, Kats and Match Windows
  in one drop-down instead of a row of buttons, so more themes fit. Kats pairs gunmetal grey with a vivid orange
  (#FF5C00) for buttons, ticks and selection, with dark text on the orange so it stays easy to read. The brand bar
  follows a dark theme's own colours; only the light theme keeps the dark bar.
- **Send your modlist to a Steam collection.** Drop Pod > More > Send the active mods to a Steam collection creates a
  Workshop collection of the ticked Workshop mods, in load order, or updates one you made before so it matches
  exactly: inactive mods are taken out and new ones added. The base game, DLC and local mods that aren't on the
  Workshop are left out (and named). Each modlist remembers its collection. It goes through the Steam client, so Steam
  must be running and signed in.
- **Instances: separate RimWorld setups.** Drop Pod > Instance > New makes one with its own options, mod list, saves
  and log, so a test list or a heavy modded run never touches your normal game. It can start from the active mods,
  only the base game and DLC, or a saved modlist, copies your game options and key bindings if you like, and can run
  another RimWorld install (an older version, say). Pick it in the Instance list to edit its mods, and press Play to
  start RimWorld with it (RimWorld's own -savedatafolder switch). More exports an instance to a zip, with or without
  its saves, imports one, opens its folder or deletes it.
- **Saves know their mods.** Drop Pod > Saves lists the saves of the normal game or the picked instance, newest
  first, with the game version and how each save's mods differ from the active ones: not installed, installed but
  not active, extra, or in another order. Use this save's mods makes the active list match it (and offers to download
  the missing ones from the Workshop); Save as a modlist keeps it for later. Only the top of each save is read, so
  even very large saves open at once, and a damaged save says so instead of failing.
- **Test a mod list and read the log.** Drop Pod > Test starts RimWorld (or the picked instance) and watches its log
  as it plays; Problems > Read the log reads the last one. Errors and warnings are grouped (the same failure in the
  same code counts once, however many pawns it hits), and each names the mod most likely at fault: its code in the
  stack trace (read from the mod's DLLs, never run), its Harmony patch on a method there, a file in its folder, or
  its package ID in the text. Untick the mod at fault takes it off the list to try again; Copy a report gives a
  short summary to paste in a bug report. Logs of any size are read a line at a time.
- **Insight into clashes and speed.** Drop Pod > Problems > Insight reads the active mods' DLLs (without running
  them) for the Harmony patches they declare and points out methods two mods both rewrite with transpilers, prefixes
  that can stop other mods' changes from running, and mods that change many per-tick methods. It also names mods with
  a lot of textures or definition files (they add to loading time) and lists your rules file's notes. These are
  hints, not measurements.

## 1.6.0

- **The space beside the mod list is put to use.** On a wide window the list's columns ended about halfway across and
  the rest was empty. A details panel now sits there: the selected mod's preview image at a size you can see, the
  version to upload and the one on Steam, its subscribers, favourites, views, size and visibility on Steam, its last
  upload from this PC and its Workshop tags, what it still needs, the change note and description it will upload with,
  and buttons for its Workshop page, version, Steam page, stats, folder, package preview and upload history. With no
  mod selected it counts the list by status, the ticked mods and the subscribers across them. Drag the bar between the
  list and the panel to resize it (the width is remembered), or turn it off in Options > Appearance. When the window
  is too narrow for both, the panel stays hidden so the columns keep their room.
- **The Mods card's title row fits again.** Since the Groups button joined it, the row was wider than the window at its
  default size, so the MODS heading and the start of the filter box were cut off at the left. Its buttons are now the
  compact kind the Log card uses, and the filter box is a little narrower.

## 1.5.0

- **Steam comes back online after uploading.** Steam lets an account sign in once at a time, so SteamCMD's login left
  the Steam client disconnected until you restarted it. When Steam was running before an upload, it is now closed and
  started again in the tray, where its saved login signs it back in: before the tags, required items, gallery and
  translations that go through it, and once the batch ends. It is left alone while a game is running or when Steam
  signs in as a different account. On by default (Options > Uploading), also for command-line and scheduled uploads;
  **Restart Steam now** there does it by hand, and Check setup warns when Steam has no saved login to sign back in with.
- **A tidier right-click menu.** The mod list's menu had grown to 18 items in one long list. The everyday ones (Workshop
  page, version, changelog entry) stay at the top, and the rest are grouped: **On Steam** (open, stats and comments,
  tags, required items, checking and downloading Steam's copy, game betas), **Package** (preview, upload history, kept
  packages, shrinking the preview image), **Open**, **Copy** and **Ticked mods**. Ctrl+K still finds every item, named
  with its group ("Copy: Workshop ID"), and submenus follow the dark or light theme.
- **The request window fits its contents.** With Report a bug or Suggest a feature picked, the request row was wider
  than the window, so the summary box, the "About" choice and the Cancel button were cut off at the right, worst with
  larger text. The window now widens to fit, its drop-downs share the row, and the explanations wrap at its width.

## 1.4.1

- **What's new reads properly.** The window that shows the changes after an update (and from Options > About) broke
  every item mid-sentence where this changelog wraps its lines, with stray indents and no bold. It now shows a heading
  per version, real bullets that wrap to the window's width, the lead phrase in bold and commands in a fixed-width
  font. The release notes on GitHub no longer break mid-sentence either.

## 1.4.0

- **Secrets never ship.** Every package is searched before upload for things that must never become public: Steam's
  own saved login (`ssfn*` files, a `config.vdf` with a login cache), private keys and key stores, `.env` files, the
  request key, and tokens with a known shape (GitHub, Discord webhooks, Slack, AWS, Google, Linear, Anthropic). One of
  those stops the upload and names the file and line, never the secret. Looser shapes (an OpenAI-style key, a Steam
  Web API key) are warned about.
- **The confirmation warns about more.** With git packaging it says when the branch is behind its upstream (you would
  upload older work) or has commits that are not pushed while GitHub releases are on. Unclosed or stray Steam BBCode
  tags in a change note or a new description are pointed out, and a new item's preview whose real format Steam does
  not take (a WebP, BMP or TIFF, whatever its extension says), that is tiny, or whose extension does not match is
  flagged in the list.
- **Preview as on Steam.** The upload confirmation and the Workshop page editor open the change note or description
  in the browser the way Steam shows BBCode: headings, lists, links, quotes, code, spoilers and tables.
- **RimWorld: translation gaps and Harmony.** Keys the English `Keyed` files have and a language lacks (players see
  the raw key), and keys English no longer has, are warned about per language. So are a mod that ships its own
  `0Harmony.dll` and one whose code uses Harmony without listing `brrainz.harmony` in `modDependencies`.
- **Add a game version to ticked mods.** When a new RimWorld version comes out, one action adds it to
  `supportedVersions` of every ticked mod, copies the newest version folder to it and adds it to `loadFolders.xml`
  (`SteamCmdHelper game-version 1.7 --all`, `--no-copy` for About.xml only).
- **Change the version of ticked mods** at once (patch, minor, major or a number), each with its changelog line.
- **Mod groups.** **Groups** in the Mods card saves the ticked mods as a named group for that mods folder and ticks a
  group in one click; `upload --group Core` on the command line.
- **Command palette.** Ctrl+K (or Ctrl+Shift+P) finds any button, menu item or Options section by name and runs it.
- **A notification when a run ends** while the window is in the background, with how it went (Options > Uploading).
- **After uploading.** Upload tags can be pushed to the remote straight away (Options > Git & GitHub;
  `upload --tag --push-tags`). A command per mods folder runs after each successful upload with the mod's name,
  folder, version, Workshop id and link, commit and change note in `SCH_*` environment variables
  (`upload --run-after`). And a zip of exactly what each upload sent can be kept (the newest 5 per mod; **Uploaded
  packages** on the right-click menu).
- **Lists and history out.** **Copy the mod list as** Markdown, Steam BBCode or CSV (`list --markdown`, `list --csv`),
  and the upload history as CSV from the history window, Options > About or `history --csv`.
  `SteamCmdHelper note MyMod` prints the change note exactly as Steam would get it.
- **Check setup.** Options > About > **Check setup** (and `SteamCmdHelper doctor`) goes through everything an upload
  needs: the mods folder, its layout and app ID, how many mods need fixing, SteamCMD and the saved login (really
  logging in from the window, or with `doctor --login`), git when the layout packages with it, gh when GitHub releases
  are on, the Discord link, the Steam client when tags or required items go through it, the Thunderstore token, free
  disk space and the data folder. It says what to fix and changes nothing.
- **Upload later.** **Later...** next to Upload schedules the ticked mods for a time you pick through Windows Task
  Scheduler, which runs the command line with your saved login, so the window need not stay open; if the PC is off
  then, it runs as soon as it can. The same window lists and cancels scheduled uploads
  (`SteamCmdHelper schedule --at "2026-10-21 18:00" MyMod`, `schedule --list`, `schedule --cancel 1`).

## 1.3.8

- **Thunderstore too.** For BepInEx games, a mod whose folder has Thunderstore's manifest.json, icon.png and README.md
  can be published to Thunderstore from the same package as Steam (right-click > **Publish to Thunderstore**, or
  after every Steam upload). The version to upload goes into the packaged manifest, what Thunderstore would refuse
  (name, version, description length, icon size, dependency format) is named first, and a version Thunderstore
  already has is skipped. Team, community and categories are set per mods folder in **Options > Uploading**; the
  service account token is kept encrypted for your Windows user.
- **The app in German, Russian and Chinese.** Options > Appearance > Language switches the windows' buttons, labels,
  menus and tooltips to Deutsch, Русский or 简体中文 from the next start (log lines and messages stay in English).
  **Make a translation file** writes every text the windows showed, filled in where the language has it, so a
  translation can be fixed or a new language added by putting the file in the data folder's languages folder.
- **New mod.** Ctrl+N (or **New mod...** on the right-click menu and the empty list) makes a ready-to-upload mod folder
  for the current layout. For RimWorld that is an About.xml with a packageId made from the author and name, the
  supported versions (the newest any of your mods supports by default), a placeholder preview, the changelog entry
  and the description file, and optionally a C# project with Harmony that builds into the newest version's Assemblies
  folder. Paradox mods get a descriptor.mod. The author is remembered for the next one.
- **Required items are set on the Workshop page.** After each upload, the item's "Required items" on Steam are set from
  the Workshop links in the mod's metadata (RimWorld's `modDependencies`), so players who subscribe are offered what the
  mod needs. Like tags, this goes through the Steam client, which has to be running as the item's owner. Items this app
  added are taken off when the mod stops listing them; items added by hand on Steam stay. **Update required items** on
  a mod's right-click menu does it without uploading, and **Options > Uploading** can turn it off.
- **RimWorld mod checks.** Before upload, RimWorld mods are checked for what would give players red errors: an XML file
  in `Defs`, `Patches`, `Languages` or `About` that does not parse, or a missing `packageId`, stops the upload with the
  file and line. A `packageId` RimWorld would refuse, two mods with the same `packageId`, a `modDependencies` entry
  without one, `loadFolders.xml` entries for folders that are not there or versions it leaves out, and version folders
  that `supportedVersions` does not list are warned about.
- **Workshop pages of ticked mods...** (right-click, with two or more mods ticked) sets one visibility, replaces a
  phrase or adds text at the end of every ticked mod's description at once. The changes wait for each mod's next upload
  and show in the upload confirmation, like single edits. An item whose page Steam won't show keeps its description.
- **Workshop stats.** Right-click a mod > **Stats and comments...** charts current subscribers, favourites, unique
  visitors and subscribers ever, for one mod or all of them together, with the change over 7 and 30 days. The counts
  come from Steam's public item details once a day; favourites also show in the row tooltip.
- **New comments.** **Count comments** in the same window counts the comments on every mod through the Steam client and
  names the mods with new ones in the log and their row tooltip; **Open comments** opens the item's comments and marks
  them read. **Options > Workshop page** can count them at start-up while Steam is running (at most every 6 hours).
- **Gallery images and videos.** A `Gallery` folder in a RimWorld mod (any folder, for custom layouts: `GalleryFolder`)
  holds PNG, JPG or GIF images and a `videos.txt` of YouTube links. After each upload the item's extra images and
  videos on Steam are made to match it: new ones are added, changed images replaced, ones the folder no longer has
  removed. The folder is never packaged.
- **Descriptions in other languages.** A file next to the description file such as `steam_description.german.txt` (or
  `.de.txt`, `.zh.txt` and other short codes) is sent as that language's description, and a first line `Title: ...` as
  its title, so players with Steam in that language read the page in it. Only changed translations are sent again.
- Gallery and translations go through the Steam client like tags. **Update required items, gallery and languages** on
  the right-click menu sends them without uploading, and **Options > Uploading** can turn them off.
- **Dependency updates are pointed out.** The upload confirmation says when a Workshop item a mod needs (Harmony, a
  framework) was updated on Steam after the mod's own last upload, so it can be tried in game with it first.
- **Shared description footer** (Options > Workshop page > Description, per mods folder): text such as Discord, Ko-fi
  or GitHub links added to the end of every description sent from a description file, with `{name}`, `{id}` and
  `{game}` filled in. Changing it counts as a changed description, so each mod offers its new text at its next upload.
  New items are created with it too.
- **Move to another PC.** **Options > About > Export settings...** saves the settings, profiles, per-folder options and
  upload history in one zip; **Import settings...** on the new PC asks where each mods folder is now and keeps a backup
  of what it replaces. SteamCMD and its saved login are never included.
- **What's new.** The first start after an update shows the changelog of the versions just installed, once, and
  **Options > About > What's new...** shows every version's changes.

## 1.3.7

- **Refresh keeps your place.** Refreshing (F5, or the refresh after an upload, a version change or a changelog entry)
  keeps the mods you ticked, the selected mod and the scroll position, instead of ticking every mod again. Mods that
  just uploaded are unticked, so pressing Upload again doesn't send them twice.
- **One Steam login per upload.** When the login worked in the last 15 minutes, Upload goes straight to SteamCMD instead
  of starting it once more just to check. If Steam refuses the login after all, **Log in again and retry** appears as
  before.
- **The window never freezes on Refresh.** Every refresh reads the mods folder and git in the background.
- **A faster log.** New lines are drawn about ten times a second instead of one by one, so SteamCMD's output no longer
  slows the window down, and the log box is trimmed so a long session stays quick.
- **Upload checks ride along.** With **Check uploads** and one login per batch, Steam's copies are downloaded back in
  the same SteamCMD run as the uploads, so a batch of ten logs in once instead of eleven times.
- **Packages are built ahead.** A batch packages the next mods (up to three at a time) while the current one is
  checked and uploaded.
- **The list refreshes by itself.** When you come back to the window and a mod was changed, added or removed, or a
  commit was made, the list refreshes. It never does this during an upload or while a dialog is open.
- **The window is remembered.** Its size and place (and whether it was maximised), the list's column widths, the sort
  column and the last Options section come back the next time the app starts.
- **The list stays usable during an upload.** You can scroll it, select mods, read their details and use the search
  box and **Hide up to date** while an upload runs. Ticks and edits still wait until it's done.
- **Less waiting on git.** Whether the folder is a git repo is asked once per refresh or upload instead of for every mod.

## 1.3.6

- **Options are sorted into sections.** The Options tab now works like Steam's own settings window: a list down the
  left (Account, Uploading, Workshop page, SteamCMD, Git & GitHub, Appearance, About) and one section at a time on the
  right, with its name and what it is for at the top. Uploading is split into Before, While and After uploading (the
  Discord and GitHub release settings now live under After uploading), and cards whose settings belong to the current
  mods folder say so in their title. **Ctrl+PageDown** / **Ctrl+PageUp** (or Up and Down in the list) move between
  sections, and links such as the login status next to Upload open the right section. Every setting and its saved
  value is unchanged.

## 1.3.5

- **A new, more polished look.** The app now follows the style of Steam's own desktop client: deep slate-blue
  surfaces, a dark brand bar across the top (in the light theme too) with the name, a new icon and capital-letter tabs,
  card headings in capitals over a fading blue line, softly rounded buttons in light blue on slate, blue for the
  suggested next step and a green **Upload** button. A strip along the bottom shows the version next to the "not
  affiliated" line. The light theme gets the same treatment in light colours, and Windows High Contrast is unchanged.

## 1.3.4

- **One SteamCMD login per batch.** A new option (off by default, `--one-session` on the command line) packages and
  checks every ticked mod, then uploads them all in one SteamCMD run, so a batch logs in once instead of once per mod.
- **Check uploads on Steam.** An option (off by default, `--verify`) downloads each upload back with
  `workshop_download_item` and compares its files with what was sent. **Check what Steam hands out** on the right-click
  menu (and `verify <mod>`) does the same at any time.
- **Download from Steam.** Right-click a mod (or `download <mod|id> --to <folder>`) to save Steam's copy into an empty
  folder, for when the local copy is lost.
- **New game builds are noticed.** At start-up (at most every 12 hours) the app reads the game's branches with
  SteamCMD's anonymous login and says when there is a new public build or a beta changed. **Options > SteamCMD >
  Game branches** and `game-builds` list them.
- **Try in a game beta.** Installs a separate copy of the game on any branch with SteamCMD, and puts the selected mod
  and the Workshop items it depends on into its mods folder (`test-install` on the command line).
- **Upload from GitHub Actions.** **Options > Git > Set up GitHub Actions upload** (or `ci-setup`) writes a workflow
  that uploads changed mods when a `v*` tag is pushed. **Copy login secret** (or `login-secret`) gives the saved login
  for its secret.
- **Ownership check.** The first upload for a game checks that the account owns it (`licenses_print`) and warns when
  it doesn't, since Steam would refuse the upload.
- **No more hanging runs.** SteamCMD now runs with `@ShutdownOnFailedCommand` and `@NoPromptForPassword` whenever
  nobody can type into it, so an expired login ends a scheduled or CI run with an error instead of waiting.
- The README explains which features use Steam's anonymous login and which need your saved login.

## 1.3.3

- **Workshop tags are set.** SteamCMD cannot send tags, so uploads never changed them and RimWorld mods did not show
  up under a new version's filter (such as 1.7). After each upload the app now sets the tags through the Steam client,
  the way RimWorld's own uploader does: `Mod` plus one tag per `supportedVersions` entry in `About/About.xml`. Version
  tags the mod no longer lists are taken off; any other tag is kept. Steam has to be running and signed in as the
  account that owns the mod. A failed tag update is a warning, not a failed upload.
- **Update Workshop tags** on a mod's right-click menu fixes the tags of mods already on Steam without uploading them.
- Turn it off under **Options > Uploading**. Custom layouts can set tags too, with `Tags` and `VersionTagsKey` in
  `.steamhelper.json`.

## 1.3.2

- **RimWorld version-folder builds are uploaded.** Mods that build into version folders (`1.6/Assemblies`,
  `1.7/Assemblies`) went up without their `.dll` files when packaging from git, because most mod repos ignore `*.dll`.
  The RimWorld layout now picks up `*/Assemblies/*.dll` as well as the root `Assemblies/` folder.
- **Left-out files are caught before upload.** Git packaging now compares the package with the mod folder. A `.dll`
  that is in the folder but not in the package stops the upload with a message naming it, and any other left-out file
  is a warning in the log. **Preview package...** lists left-out files at the end.

## 1.3.1

- **Setup.exe that updates like other desktop apps.** Each release now also has `SteamCmdHelper-<version>-Setup.exe`
  (built with [Velopack](https://velopack.io)). It installs the app for your Windows user with Start menu and desktop
  shortcuts, no administrator rights needed, and updates it with a separate updater that swaps versions after the app
  has closed and only downloads what changed. The standalone exe and the framework-dependent zip still update
  themselves as before.
- **Safer self-update.** Updating from 1.2.1 to 1.3.0 could crash the closing window and leave only a
  `.update-old` copy of the exe behind. The updater now waits until the old copy has really closed before replacing
  it, checks that the new exe is in place and matches the download, and if it is missing or will not start, puts the
  old version back, starts it and says why. Each step is written to `update.log`.

## 1.3.0

- **What changed since the last upload.** Each upload remembers which files it sent, so the next upload of that item
  lists in the log what was added, changed and removed since then, and **Preview package...** marks each file (removed
  files are listed at the end).
- **Nothing changed?** When a package is the same, file for file, as the last upload from this PC and no Workshop page
  change goes with it, the app asks before uploading it again (subscribers would only get a new change note). Skipped
  mods show as `SKIPPED` in the summary. The command line uploads it with a warning.
- **Size jumps** are warned about: a package less than half or more than twice the size of the last upload (by at
  least 1 MB), or one that lost many of its files, usually means a missing build folder or something added by mistake.
- **Paths that break for some players** are warned about: paths over 160 characters (they can pass Windows'
  260-character limit once installed), names that differ only in capital letters, and names Windows refuses
  (`CON`, `NUL`, `aux.ogg`, `<>:"|?*`, a trailing dot or space).
- **Required files must ship.** A package without the layout's marker file (RimWorld's `About/About.xml`, a Paradox
  `descriptor.mod`) is refused, as it would break the mod for everyone who updates. Custom layouts can list more with
  `RequiredFiles` (paths or globs).
- **Markdown change notes look right on Steam.** When the changelog is a `.md` file, headings, bold, italics,
  strike-through, bullet and numbered lists, links, quotes, rules and code blocks are turned into Steam's BBCode for
  the change note. Untick it under **Options > Change notes**.
- **Change note template** (Options > Change notes, per mods folder): text wrapped around every note sent to Steam,
  with `{note}`, `{name}`, `{version}`, `{date}` and `{game}` filled in. The command line uses it too.
- **Same version as on Steam?** The upload confirmation warns when Steam already has the version a ticked mod would
  upload, which usually means the version was not raised.
- **Version mismatches** are warned about in the list: a changelog with an entry newer than the version to upload,
  and an `About/Manifest.xml` whose version differs from `About.xml`'s.
- **Replace the preview image** of an item already on Steam: **Workshop page...** has a **Preview image** row (the
  mod's own preview file, or any PNG, JPG or GIF up to 1 MB), sent with the next upload. Before, the preview was only
  sent when an item was created.
- **Keep the description in sync.** When a mod's description file differs from its Workshop page (or, for items Steam
  won't show, from what this PC last sent), the upload offers to send it too. **Options > Workshop page** can do it
  every time without asking (the command line follows that) or never.
- **Build step** (Options > Uploading, per mods folder): a command such as `dotnet build -c Release` runs in the mods
  folder before anything is packaged. If it fails, nothing is uploaded. The command line runs it too (`--no-build`
  skips it).
- **Upload from a branch or tag** (Options > Uploading, or `--ref` on the command line): git packaging takes that
  branch or tag instead of the checked-out commit, with the version and change note read from it. Upload tags and
  GitHub releases go on the commit that was uploaded.
- **Roll back**: **Upload history...** has **Upload this version again**, which re-uploads an earlier version from its
  upload tag (or the commit at that time) with its old change note marked as rolled back.
- **Test items**: **Upload to test items** (or `--test`) sends the ticked mods to private copies on Steam, created on
  first use and kept in `workshop_id.test.txt`, so a build can be checked in game before subscribers get it.
- **Automatic retry**: an update that fails because Steam timed out, was busy or could not be reached is tried once
  more after 30 seconds (Options > Uploading).
- **Tick changed** ticks only the mods whose version Steam does not have yet.

- **Change notes keep their line breaks on Steam.** Uploads used to show a literal `\n` wherever the changelog had a
  new line, because SteamCMD reads the build file without escape sequences. Line breaks are now written as real line
  breaks, backslashes are left as typed, and straight double quotes become curly ones (a straight quote would end the
  value). The same applies to a Workshop page's title and description.
- **"Uploaded via SteamCMD Helper"** is added to the end of each change note on Steam, linking to the newest release.
  Turn it off under Options > Change notes. The upload history and Discord announcements keep the entry as written.
- **Command line:** `upload --tag`, `--commit-ids` and `--announce` do the steps the window offers after an upload:
  tag what was uploaded, commit the Workshop id files of new items, and post to Discord and GitHub releases.
- **Command line:** `upload --note "..."` uploads with that change note, and `upload --note-from-git` drafts each
  mod's note from its commits since the last upload. `upload --json` prints a JSON summary of what happened to each
  mod (status, Workshop id, tag) on standard output, with the progress on standard error.
- **Past logs.** Every upload run's log is saved, from the window and the command line; **Past logs** in the Log card
  lists them by time and what was uploaded. The newest 50 are kept.

## 1.2.1

- **Updating the app no longer crashes it.** The running app used to replace its own exe and then crash with "Something
  went wrong" (a missing `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`) as it closed, because .NET still reads parts of the program
  from that file. Now the downloaded version installs itself after the old one has closed, then starts. Updates from
  1.2.0 and earlier still run the old way once, so that one update may still show the error; the new version is
  installed regardless.
- **Opens faster.** The standalone exe is no longer compressed (it unpacked the whole .NET runtime on every start)
  and is compiled ahead of time; the mods folder is read after the window appears instead of before; and git no
  longer searches for untracked files when checking for uncommitted changes. The download is bigger as a result.
- **Command line:** `upload --changed` uploads only the mods whose version Steam does not have yet and exits `0`
  when there is nothing to do, so a CI job can run it after every push. `list --json` prints the mods (version,
  Workshop id, ready, problems and warnings) as JSON for scripts.
- **Change the version** (F2, or double-click it) has **Patch**, **Minor** and **Major** buttons that fill in the
  next version. It can now also write the version into a JSON marker file (such as `mod.json`) and a `version=` line
  (such as a Paradox `descriptor.mod`), not only XML.
- **Command line:** `version <mod> patch|minor|major|<number>` sets the version to upload, and `--note "..."` adds the
  new version's changelog entry where the layout needs one (RimWorld).
- **Draft from git commits** (in the upload confirmation and the "What changed?" box for a new version) writes the
  change note from the commits that touched the mod since its last upload from this PC, one line each, leaving out
  fixup, WIP and merge commits. It starts from the mod's upload tag when there is one, else from the upload's time.

## 1.2.0

- **Shrink preview image under 1 MB** (right-click a mod): re-saves an oversized preview just small enough for Steam,
  scaling it down only as far as needed. The original is kept in `%LocalAppData%\SteamCmdHelper\preview-backups`.
- After updating an existing item, the app asks Steam whether the item's "updated" time moved and says so in the
  log. A clean SteamCMD run that never printed `Success.` now counts as uploaded when Steam shows the update arrived,
  instead of being reported as failed.
- Uploads are no longer reported as failed when SteamCMD prints "Success." on the same line as "Committing
  update..." (as it does on Windows). Steam had taken those updates; the app just missed the confirmation.
- Refreshing the list no longer repeats every mod's "fix ..." line in the log; a mod's problems are logged again only
  when they change.
- A mod that is not on Steam yet now says to turn on **Create new items (private)** when that is all that stops it
  being ticked, instead of saying it is ready to create.

## 1.1.0

- **Update now** in the new-version prompt downloads the release, checks it against the release's SHA-256 checksums,
  installs it over the running copy (standalone exe or folder build) and restarts. Failed installs put the old files
  back. Opt in to **Install new versions automatically** under **Options > About** to download in the background and
  install when the app closes. `SteamCmdHelper update` does the same from a script.
- Unexpected errors are saved to `%LocalAppData%\SteamCmdHelper\crashes` and can be sent as a pre-filled bug report
  with **Report it**.
- Only one window opens at a time; starting the app again brings the open window to the front.
- **Options > Profiles**: save the mods folder, Steam account and SteamCMD under a name and switch between them.
- **Options > Announcements** (per mods folder): post each successful update to a Discord channel through a webhook,
  and optionally make a matching GitHub release with the gh tool.
- Workshop dependencies named in a mod's metadata are checked against Steam; private, removed or banned ones are
  warned about.
- The row tooltip shows subscriber growth this week and since the last upload, from daily counts kept on this PC.
- The upload confirmation is a window that lists each mod with its change note, which can be edited before it is sent
  (the changelog file is left alone). It offers to commit uncommitted changes first when git packaging would leave
  them out.
- Packages are checked for stray files (`.git`/`obj` folders, `.psd` and other source art, `.pdb` and leftovers,
  archives, very large files) and warned about in the log. An empty package is refused. **Preview package...** on the
  right-click menu shows every file and its size.
- After creating an item in a git repo, the app offers to commit its Workshop ID file. **Options > Git** can do that
  without asking and tag each upload as `<mod folder>-v<version>`.
- Failed uploads say what to do (log in again, wait out a rate limit, accept the Workshop agreement, check the item's
  owner or id), in the window and on the command line. A refused login offers **Log in again and retry**.
- The progress card shows the package size, the time taken so far and, from this PC's recent uploads, about how long
  is left.
- New **Paradox (descriptor.mod)** layout (experimental) for Stellaris, Hearts of Iron IV, Europa Universalis IV,
  Crusader Kings II/III and Imperator: Rome: name and version from `descriptor.mod`, the Workshop id from its
  `remote_file_id` (written back for new items), `thumbnail.png` as the preview. Custom layouts can read the id from a
  key the same way (`WorkshopIdKey`).
- Portable mode: an empty `portable.txt` next to the exe keeps settings, history and SteamCMD in a `data` folder beside it.
- Windows scale to the display's DPI (150%, 200%) instead of clipping text, and the main window fits small screens.
  Screen readers get names for inputs, progress values and the full status of each mod.
- Ease of access: everything works from the keyboard (**F1** lists the shortcuts; **Enter** and **F2** do what
  double-clicking a row does; **Esc** stops an upload; **Alt** + underlined letter for every button and box), a clear
  focus ring shows where Tab is, and screen readers are told when an upload finishes or a step is missing.
- **Options > Appearance**: **Match Windows** follows Windows' light or dark mode, Windows High Contrast is respected,
  and **Text size** makes everything larger (up to 175%).
- Look: the Project card folds into one line once it is set up and the bar between the mod list and the log can be
  dragged, so the list shows more mods; shorter column names leave the Status column room, with the selected mod's
  full status in a strip under the list; **Get set up** shows how many steps are done and the next one as a button;
  the log can show only warnings and errors and pause its auto-scroll; cards have a fine edge and one type scale.
- CI compares each pull request's screenshots with the base branch's and lists the windows that changed.
- Install with `winget install AzraelGodKing.SteamCMDHelper` or from the Scoop bucket in this repository; releases
  keep both up to date. Releases can be code-signed through SignPath, and the standalone exe is now compressed (about
  half the download).
- Batch uploads: **Tick all** / **Tick none** buttons, one login check for the whole batch, and a summary of what
  happened to each mod (uploaded, created, failed and why, not run) at the end, in the log and in a dialog. If Steam
  refuses the login part-way, the remaining mods are not tried.
- Command line for scripts and CI: `SteamCmdHelper upload <mod>... | --all`, `SteamCmdHelper list` and
  `SteamCmdHelper help`, with `--repo`, `--account`, `--steamcmd`, `--dry-run`, `--allow-create`,
  `--allow-experimental` and `--log`. Same checks and upload code as the window; exit code 0 (all done), 1 (a mod
  failed), 2 (bad arguments or nothing to upload) or 3 (SteamCMD missing or not logged in).
- Changing a RimWorld mod's version (double-click **Version to upload**) now asks what changed and writes the new
  version's entry into `About/Changelog.txt`, so the upload is not blocked for a missing entry. A row still missing
  its entry can be fixed by double-clicking its **Status**.
- **Workshop page...** (also right-click or double-click a mod's name) edits the item's title, description (with a
  counter for Steam's 8000-character limit) and visibility, starting from what Steam shows now. Ticked changes are
  sent with the mod's next upload and listed in the upload confirmation. Tags are shown but cannot be changed, as
  SteamCMD has no way to set them.
- At start-up the app checks GitHub for a newer release and offers to download it (or show its notes, or skip that
  version). It can be turned off, or run on demand with **Check now**, under **Options > About**.
- New **Updated on Steam** column: each item's last update date, read live from Steam's public item details in one
  request. Private, friends-only or removed items show `not public`; the row tooltip adds the title, visibility and
  subscriber count on Steam.
- Upload history: every successful upload from this PC is recorded with its time, version and change note.
  Right-click a mod for **Upload history...** or **Open on Steam**.
- **Uploaded version** falls back to that history, and shows `?` when Steam has a newer update than this PC's last
  upload. The tooltip says where the version came from.

- A **Get set up** box lists what is still missing (SteamCMD, Steam account, mods folder, app ID), each a link that
  does it, and goes away when all four are done. Missing pieces are pointed out next to where they are fixed instead
  of in pop-ups.
- Mods folder: recent folders are in a drop-down, and a folder can be dropped onto the window to open it.
- Mod list: a filter box, **Hide up to date**, sorting by any column, status badges (`Fix`, `Failed`, `Changed`,
  `New`, `Up to date`, `Ready`) with the first problem or warning beside them, preview thumbnails, and an empty
  state that says what to do. Right-click adds **Open mod folder**, **Open changelog**, **Copy Workshop ID** and
  **Copy Workshop link**.
- **Retry failed** uploads only the mods that failed or were not reached in the last run.
- Upload progress shows on the taskbar button, which flashes when a run ends in the background.
- The log has timestamps, **Copy**, **Save...**, **Clear** and **SteamCMD logs**.
- Shortcuts: F5 refresh, Ctrl+O pick the mods folder, Ctrl+F filter, Ctrl+Enter upload.
- Look: an app icon, a title bar that matches the theme on Windows 11, readable disabled buttons, themed right-click
  menus, the progress card only while it has something to show, **Dry run** and **Create new items** next to the
  Upload button, and an Options tab with its own SteamCMD and **Your data** cards.

## 1.0.0

First release.

- Dark theme by default, with a light theme under **Options > Appearance** (saved per Windows user). Dark title bar
  and scroll bars on Windows 10 1809 and later; the log keeps its console look in both themes.
- Cleaner main window: a top bar with **Upload** and **Options** tabs, grouped Project, Mods and progress panels,
  flat buttons with a highlighted Upload button, and slim progress bars. The Steam login (account name, Check login,
  Log in, Install SteamCMD) moved to the **Options** tab; its status stays next to the Upload button as a link there.
- At start-up, a missing SteamCMD is detected and the app offers to install it, warning that uploads won't work
  without it; if declined, the log and the status line say so until it is installed.
- A "not affiliated with Valve or Steam" notice at the bottom of the window, under Options > About and in the README.
- Pre-upload checks are basic: only a missing or over-1 MB preview on a new item, an unreadable id or metadata file,
  and for RimWorld the Add Changenote rules (version from `About/Manifest.xml` or `About/About.xml`, and an entry for it
  in `About/Changelog.txt`, which becomes the change note) block an upload. Everything else is a warning. Mods without
  an id file show Workshop ID `0` (a new item).
- Mod list columns: Uploaded version (read from the item's newest Steam change note, else this PC's last upload),
  Version to upload (double-click to edit; written to About/Manifest.xml and About.xml), Workshop ID, Preview (✔ / ✖
  for Steam's 1 MB limit) and a short Status (Ready, Fix, Ready to create). Details are in each row's tooltip.
- Mod list with name, version, Workshop id and pre-upload checks; Steam login detection with a one-time login
  window in SteamCMD (this app never sees your password); dry run, create-new-item option, progress bars and a live log.
- Works for any Steam game: Steam app ID box (game name looked up from Steam) and layouts that describe how the mods
  are laid out. Mod metadata can come from XML, JSON or plain-text/Lua files; mods can sit in a sub-folder; changelog
  and version are optional.
- Built-in layouts (Generic, RimWorld, experimental Golf With Your Friends) are part of the program and locked: the
  repo's `.steamhelper.json` only records which one is used, and layouts that name a game fix the app ID. Only the
  **Custom** layout is stored in full and editable. Without a layout file, RimWorld or Generic is auto-detected.
  Experimental layouts ask for confirmation before a real upload.
- The **?** button requests a built-in layout for another game. Builds with the Linear request key send it straight
  from the app (one per minute, showing exactly what will be sent); other builds open a pre-filled Linear issue or copy the text.
- The mods repo path can only be changed with **Browse...** (or by double-clicking it), so it cannot be mistyped.
- Upload success is confirmed, not guessed: SteamCMD must exit 0, print no failure line (`ERROR!`, `...FAILED`,
  `Failed to update/upload/commit`), print `Success.`, and for a new item return its Workshop id. Harmless lines that
  merely contain "error" or "failed" (a file named `Error.png`, SteamCMD's SDL notice) do not fail an upload.
- When creating a new item, the id Steam assigns is saved even if the run fails afterwards, so it is never created twice.
- Install SteamCMD downloads to `%LocalAppData%\SteamCmdHelper` and checks the download before installing: complete
  length, every zip entry passes its CRC, `steamcmd.exe` is present, and it carries a valid Authenticode signature from Valve.
- Temporary package folders are removed after dry runs, failed checks, packaging errors and cancellation. A failed
  upload keeps its folder for inspection; such folders are swept after 7 days.
- Headless checks: `--selftest`, `--package`, `--layouttest`, `--urltest`, with `--repo <folder>`.
- Unit tests in `tests/SteamCmdHelper.Tests` (`dotnet test`, runs on any OS).
