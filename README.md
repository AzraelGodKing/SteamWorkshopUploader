# Steam Workshop Uploader

Windows desktop app for uploading your mods to the Steam Workshop without remembering any SteamCMD commands. Open it,
tick the mods, press **Upload**. It shows each mod's version and Workshop id, checks the changelog before sending
anything, handles the Steam login, and shows progress bars and a live log.

It works for **any game with a Steam Workshop**: you give it the game's Steam app ID and tell it how your mods are
laid out (a built-in layout, or a [custom one](#custom-layouts-steamhelperjson)). RimWorld has its own built-in layout
and extra tools for RimWorld mod authors. The upload logic is built in; the only outside tool it needs is SteamCMD.

Steam Workshop Uploader started as the uploader half of [Modwright](https://github.com/AzraelGodKing/ModWright),
without Modwright's mod manager for players (The Drop Pod). It has its own settings folder, program name and updates,
so both can be installed side by side.

Steam Workshop Uploader is an independent tool. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve Corporation, Steam or
Ludeon Studios. Steam and SteamCMD are trademarks of Valve Corporation; RimWorld is a trademark of Ludeon Studios.

## Requirements

- Windows
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) to build (running needs the .NET 8 runtime, which the SDK includes)
- `git` on PATH if your repo uses the default packaging (`UseGitArchive`)
- SteamCMD: required for uploading. If it is missing at start-up the app offers to download it for you
  (also **Options > SteamCMD > Install SteamCMD**)
- A Steam account that owns the game

## Download

Each [GitHub Release](../../releases) has:

- `SteamWorkshopUploader-<version>-Setup.exe`: installs the app for your Windows user (no administrator rights) with Start
  menu and desktop shortcuts, and keeps it up to date the way most desktop apps do: a separate updater
  ([Velopack](https://velopack.io)) swaps in the new version after the app has closed, downloading only what changed.
  Recommended. Uninstall it from Windows' **Installed apps**; your settings stay in `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader`.
- `SteamWorkshopUploader-<version>-win-x64.exe`: a single self-contained exe; no .NET install needed.
- `SteamWorkshopUploader-<version>-win-x64-framework-dependent.zip`: a small folder build that needs the
  [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0). Use it if Windows or your antivirus
  refuses to launch the large single-file exe.

All of them are built from this repository by GitHub Actions.

At start-up the app asks GitHub for the latest release and, when it is newer, offers **Update now**, **Release notes**,
or **Later**, with a box to stop reminding you about that version. **Update now** downloads the release file that matches
how you run the app (the update package for a Setup.exe install, the standalone exe, or the framework-dependent zip for
the folder build), checks it against the
release's checksums and restarts: the new version installs itself once the old one has closed, then opens. If
anything fails, the old files are put back. When the app's folder
cannot be written to (for example under Program Files), it offers **Download** through your browser instead.

Tick **Install new versions automatically** under **Options > About** to skip the question: a newer release is then
downloaded and checked in the background and installed when you close the app (or press **Restart now** there). It is off
by default. Only the public releases list and the release files are read; nothing about you or your mods is sent. Turn
the check off, or **Check now**, under **Options > About**. From a script, `SteamWorkshopUploader update` does the same.

### Install with winget or Scoop

```
winget install AzraelGodKing.SteamWorkshopUploader
```

```
scoop bucket add steamworkshopuploader https://github.com/AzraelGodKing/SteamWorkshopUploader
scoop install steamworkshopuploader
```

Both install the standalone exe and put `steamworkshopuploader` on your PATH, so the command line below works from any
terminal. `winget upgrade` and `scoop update` pick up new releases.

## Build and run

```powershell
dotnet build SteamWorkshopUploader.csproj -c Release
```

The program is `bin\Release\net8.0-windows\SteamWorkshopUploader.exe`. Make a shortcut to it.

Branches: `main` is the released version and `test` is where new work comes together; pull requests go to `test`, and `test` is merged into `main` for each release. CI builds and tests every push to `main` or `test` and every pull request. For pull requests it also builds the base branch,
takes the same `--shot` screenshots, and lists in the job summary which windows changed (the changed pixels are in red
in the `screenshot-diffs` artifact). That step is informational and never fails the build. To release, bump `<Version>` in
`SteamWorkshopUploader.csproj` and add a matching `## <version>` section to `CHANGELOG.md` on `test`, then run
**Promote test and release** (see [Releasing](#releasing-maintainer)).

## Using it

Until everything below is in place, a **Get set up** box at the top of the Launch Pad tab lists the four steps
(SteamCMD, Steam account, mods folder, app ID), each a link that does it, says how many are done and offers the next
one as a button. It goes away once they are done. Once the mods folder, app ID and mods are all found, the **Project**
card folds into one line (folder, game, layout, branch); **Change...** or a click on that line opens it again, which
leaves the mod list more room.

1. **Mods repo**: press **Browse...** (or Ctrl+O) and pick the folder that holds your mods (one sub-folder per mod), or
   drop the folder onto the window. Folders you used before are in the drop-down, so switching repos is one click.
   The path cannot be typed in, so it cannot be mistyped.
2. **Steam app ID**: the number in the game's store URL (`store.steampowered.com/app/294100/...` = RimWorld).
   The game name is looked up from Steam to confirm it. RimWorld-shaped repos are detected automatically.
3. **Layout**: pick a built-in layout (**Generic**, **RimWorld**, **Paradox (descriptor.mod)**, **Golf With Your Friends**). Built-in layouts are part of the program and are **locked**: they cannot be edited, and the layout fixes the app ID. For anything else pick **Custom**, then **Edit layout file...** (below).
   The choice is saved in `.steamhelper.json` in the repo root; for a built-in layout that file holds only its name (and your app ID for Generic).
4. **Steam account** (on the **Options** tab, under **Account**): type your Steam login name. The status line says whether a saved login
   exists; the same status shows next to the Upload button, and clicking it opens Options.
   **Install SteamCMD** downloads it to `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\steamcmd` (or uses
   `<repo>\_tools\steamcmd` if that exists).
5. **Log in** happens automatically on the first upload. A SteamCMD window opens; type your password and the
   Steam Guard code there. This app never sees your password. Afterwards the login is cached.
   Logging in through SteamCMD can knock the regular Steam client offline; use Steam > Go Online afterwards.
6. Tick the mods (**Tick all** picks every mod that is ready) and press **Upload**. Several mods upload one after
   another with a single login check; if Steam refuses the login part-way, the rest are not tried. When more than
   one mod was picked, or anything failed, a summary lists what happened to each mod (it is also in the log).
   **Tick changed** picks only the mods whose version Steam does not have yet (the window's `upload --changed`).
   **Dry run** does every check and builds the package but uploads nothing. The taskbar button shows the progress
   and flashes when a run ends while the window is in the background. If anything failed or was not reached,
   **Retry failed** uploads just those mods again.

Before anything is sent, the confirmation lists each mod and what it will do on Steam, with its change note. When Steam
already has the version a ticked mod would upload, it says so at the top: raise the version first (F2) if the upload
changes anything. Click a
mod to read or edit its note; an edit changes only what is sent to Steam, not the changelog file (**Use the changelog
entry** puts it back). In a git repo, **Draft from git commits** fills the note with one line per commit that touched
the mod since its last upload from this PC: since its upload tag (**Tag each upload in git**) when there is one, else
since that upload's time, else its newest ten commits. Fixup, squash, WIP and merge commits are left out. The same
button is in the box that asks what changed in a new RimWorld version. If git packaging would leave a mod's uncommitted changes out, the confirmation offers to commit
them first. While a mod uploads, the progress card shows the package size, how long it has been running and, once this
PC has a few uploads in its history, about how long is left. When Steam turns an upload down, the summary says what to
do (for example, log in again, wait out a login rate limit, or accept the Workshop agreement), and a refused login
offers **Log in again and retry**.

Every package is checked for files that are rarely meant for players: `.git` or `obj` folders, source art such as
`.psd` or `.blend`, debug and leftover files (`.pdb`, `Thumbs.db`, ...), archives, and very large files. These are
warnings in the log; only an empty package is refused, because it would remove every file from the item.
Paths that break for some players are warned about too: paths long enough to pass Windows' 260-character limit once
installed, names that differ only in capital letters (they overwrite each other on Windows and macOS), and names
Windows refuses (`CON`, `NUL`, `aux.ogg`, `<>:"|?*`, a trailing dot or space). A package that is missing the layout's
marker file (such as RimWorld's `About/About.xml`) or one of its `RequiredFiles` is refused, because the mod would break
for everyone who updates; that usually means a `.gitattributes` export-ignore rule or the `Exclude` list dropped it.
When packaging with git, files in the mod folder that git does not have (ignored by `.gitignore` or not committed) are
compared against the package: a `.dll` left out that way stops the upload, since players would get the mod without its
code, and anything else left out is a warning. The RimWorld layout picks up builds in `Assemblies` and in version
folders such as `1.6/Assemblies` even when `*.dll` is ignored.
Right-click a mod and choose **Package > Preview package...** to see every file and its size before uploading. It says which folders hold most of the size (click **Size** to sort by it) and lists what players rarely need (source art, debug files, a Source folder); **Leave these out of every package** saves those patterns as `LeaveOut` in `.steamhelper.json`, for git packaging too.

Each upload remembers which files it sent (`%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\manifests`), so the next one of the same item
says in the log what was added, changed and removed since then, and **Preview package...** marks each file. A package
that is much smaller or larger than last time, or that lost many files, is warned about. When nothing at all changed
since the last upload (and no Workshop page change goes with it), the app asks before uploading it again, since
subscribers would only get the change note; the command line uploads it with a warning.

In a git repo, after a new item is created the app offers to commit its Workshop ID file, so nobody creates the item
twice (**Options > Git & GitHub** can do it without asking). Tick **Tag each upload in git** there to tag the uploaded commit
as `<mod folder>-v<version>`; tags stay local until you push them.

The list can be filtered by name, folder or Workshop ID (Ctrl+F), **Hide up to date** drops the mods Steam already
has, and clicking a column header sorts by it (again to reverse, a third time for folder order). Right-click a mod
to open its folder or changelog, copy its Workshop ID or link, see its upload history, preview its package, or open it
on Steam. The strip under the list spells out everything the selected mod needs, in full.

When the window is wide enough, a **details panel** sits beside the list: the selected mod's preview image at a size you
can see, the version to upload and the one on Steam, its subscribers, favourites, views, size and visibility on Steam,
its last upload from this PC and its Workshop tags, what it still needs, the change note and description it will upload
with, and buttons for editing its page, changing its version, opening it on Steam or in Explorer, previewing the package
and its upload history. With nothing selected it counts the list by status. Drag the bar between list and panel to
resize it, or turn it off in **Options > Appearance** to give the list the whole width; on a narrow window the panel stays out of the way so
the columns keep their room.

Everything works from the keyboard. **F1** (or **? > Keyboard shortcuts**) lists the shortcuts: **F5** refresh,
**Ctrl+O** pick the mods folder, **Ctrl+F** filter, **Space** tick the selected mod, **Enter** edit its Workshop page,
**F2** change its version, **Shift+F10** its right-click menu, **Ctrl+Enter** upload the ticked mods, **Esc** stop a
running upload, **Ctrl+Tab** switch tabs, **Ctrl+PageDown** / **Ctrl+PageUp** move between the Options sections, and **Alt** with an underlined letter for any button or box. While you move
around with Tab or the arrow keys, the focused control has a clear ring around it. Screen readers are told when an
upload finishes and when a step is missing.

The log at the bottom stamps each line with the time and colours it by kind (blue notes, green success,
orange warnings, red errors). The drop-down next to its title shows everything, only warnings and errors, or only
errors; untick **Auto-scroll** to read back while an upload runs. Drag the bar between the mod list and the log (or Tab
to it and use the arrow keys) to give either more room; the log keeps that height. **Copy** and **Save...** take the
whole log whatever is shown, **Clear** empties it, and **SteamCMD logs** opens SteamCMD's own log folder, which is
where to look when Steam turns an upload down. Every upload run's log is also saved on its own, from the window and
the command line alike: **Past logs** lists them by time and what was uploaded, so a failure can be read back after
the window was closed. The newest 50 are kept, in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SteamWorkshopUploader\logs`.

The app uses a dark theme by default. The **Theme** drop-down under **Options > Appearance** offers **Light**, **Kats**
(gunmetal grey with orange), **Koneko** (purple and black), **Serina** (purple and mint green), **Wolfie** (blue and
green), **Vickra** (sapphire blue on emerald green), **Kitomi** (red and cyan on black with white text), **Szendoo** (dim grey with hot pink), **Triphlx** (electric blue on black), **Tohma** (crimson on royal blue), **Skywolf** (deep dark purple on black), **Hunter** (silver on black with touches of red), **PlusBacon** (teal on black), or **Match Windows** to follow Windows' light or dark app mode (it switches when Windows
does). When Windows High Contrast is on, the app uses its
contrast colours instead. **Text size** (100% to 175%) makes all text, and the layout with it, larger on top of Windows'
own display scaling; it is used from the next start. The choices are saved for your Windows user.

The checks are kept basic. A row turns red and cannot be uploaded only for things that would make the upload fail
or go wrong:

- a new item without its preview image, or a preview over 1 MB (Steam refuses both)
- an id file that is not a number, or a metadata file that cannot be read
- **RimWorld:** the same rules as the [Add Changenote](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2161604688)
  mod. The version comes from `<version>` in `About/Manifest.xml`, or else `<modVersion>` in `About/About.xml`, and
  `About/Changelog.txt` must have an entry for that version: a line starting with the version number, plus the lines
  under it up to the next version line (lines starting with `#` are skipped). That entry becomes the Workshop change note.

Everything else is only a warning: other layouts' changelog issues, missing build output, uncommitted tracked
changes (git packaging uses `HEAD`), a changelog that already has an entry newer than the version to upload, and a
`Manifest.xml` whose version differs from `About.xml`'s (the manifest's is uploaded; F2 sets both). Hover over a row to see its problems and warnings; problems are also listed in the log.

The list columns:

- **Steam version**: the version already on Steam. Steam does not store one, so it is read from the newest change
  note on the item's public changelog page (notes sent by this app for RimWorld, or by Add Changenote, start with the
  version). If that note has none, it shows what this PC last uploaded, unless Steam shows a later update (an upload
  from somewhere else), in which case it shows `?`. Private items show `?` until the first upload from this PC.
- **Updated**: when the item was last updated, read live from Steam's public item details (one request for
  the whole list, no login). `not public` means Steam hides it from anonymous readers: private, friends only, or removed.
  Hover a row for the title, visibility and subscriber count on Steam.
- **To upload**: the mod's current version. Double-click it (or press F2) to change it: type the new number, or press
  **Patch**, **Minor** or **Major** for the next one (1.2.3 becomes 1.2.4, 1.3.0 or 2.0.0). The new number is written
  to `<version>` in `About/Manifest.xml` (when it has one) and to the version in the marker file: an XML element such as
  `About/About.xml`'s, a JSON property such as `mod.json`'s, or a `version=` line such as a Paradox `descriptor.mod`'s. For RimWorld the app then asks what changed and adds that as the new version's entry in
  `About/Changelog.txt` (newest first, or at the end if the file lists the oldest version first), so the upload is
  not refused for a missing entry. If you skip it, double-click the row's **Status** to write it later.
- **Workshop ID**: from the mod's own id file (`About/PublishedFileId.txt` for RimWorld); `0` means the upload creates a new item.
- **Preview**: a thumbnail of the preview image; a red frame means it is over Steam's 1 MB limit, ✖ that it is
  missing (hover for the size). Right-click a mod and choose **Package > Shrink preview image under 1 MB** to re-save an
  oversized preview just small enough (the original is kept in `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\preview-backups`).
- **Status**: a badge, followed by the first problem or warning when there is one:
  `Fix` (red, can't be uploaded), `Failed` (red, failed in the last run), `Changed` (amber, Steam has an older
  version), `New` (blue, not on Steam yet), `Up to date` (green, Steam already has this version) or `Ready` (the
  version on Steam is not known yet).

### Workshop page: title, description and visibility

Select a mod and press **Workshop page...** (or right-click it, or double-click its name). The editor reads the item's
current title, description and visibility from Steam. Tick what to change; the changes are kept and sent with that
mod's next upload (the confirmation lists them), then cleared (an upload from the command line sends them too). Unticked fields stay as they are on Steam. For a mod not
on Steam yet, ticked fields replace the name, description file and private visibility it would be created with.
SteamCMD cannot change tags, so the editor only shows them; see **Workshop tags** below.

### Workshop tags

Players filter the Workshop by tags, such as RimWorld's `Mod` and the game versions (`1.6`, `1.7`). SteamCMD's build
file has no way to send tags, so after each upload the app sets them through the Steam client instead, the same way
RimWorld's own uploader does. For RimWorld a mod gets `Mod` plus one tag per `<li>` under `supportedVersions` in
`About/About.xml` (`1.6.4104` counts as `1.6`). Version tags the mod no longer lists are taken off, and any other tag
on the item is kept. To fix mods uploaded before this, right-click one and choose **On Steam > Update Workshop tags**: that sends
only the tags, not the files.

The Steam client has to be running and signed in as the account that owns the mod (and the game), because Steam only
takes tag changes from the game's side. While the tags are sent, Steam briefly shows you as playing the game. If it
fails, the upload still counts and the log says why. Turn it off with **Set Workshop tags after each upload** under
**Options > Uploading**. A Custom layout can give its mods tags with `Tags` (always added, for example `["Mod"]`) and
`VersionTagsKey` (an XPath in an .xml marker file, or a dotted path to an array in a .json one).

**Preview image** in the same editor replaces the item's preview on Steam with its next upload: **Use the mod's preview**
takes the layout's preview file (after you changed it), or **Choose...** any PNG, JPG or GIF up to 1 MB. Without it,
the preview on Steam is left alone; it is otherwise only sent when an item is created.

When you upload a mod that is on Steam and has a description file (`steam_description.txt` for Generic,
`About/steam_description.txt` for RimWorld), the app checks whether the file differs from the Workshop page and offers
to send it with the upload. Public and unlisted items are compared with their page on Steam; other items with what this
PC last sent. **Options > Workshop page** can send it every time without asking, or never. The command line sends it
only when that is set to **Always send it**.

The same right-click menu has **Package > Upload history...** (every upload of the mod made from this PC: when, which
version, and the change note sent) and **Open on Steam** (the item's page in your browser).

### How change notes look on Steam

Steam's change notes use BBCode, not Markdown. When the layout's changelog is a `.md` file (Generic's `CHANGELOG.md`),
the note sent to Steam is converted: `#` headings become `[h1]` to `[h3]`, `-` and `1.` lists `[list]` and `[olist]`,
`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `~~strike~~`, `[text](https://...)` links, `>` quotes, `---` rules and fenced code blocks their
tags, and inline `` `code` `` keeps its text. Untick it under **Options > Workshop page**.

The same card has a **template** for the current mods folder, wrapped around every note sent to Steam: `{note}` is the
changelog entry and `{name}`, `{version}`, `{date}` (yyyy-MM-dd) and `{game}` fill themselves in, for example

```
[b]{name} {version}[/b] ({date})
{note}
```

A template without `{note}` gets the entry after it. For RimWorld, start with `{version}`: the **Steam version** column
reads the version from the start of the newest note. The template, the conversion and the credit line change only what
Steam gets; the changelog file, the upload history and Discord announcements keep the entry as written.

### Profiles, announcements and dependencies

**Options > Account > Profiles** saves the current mods folder, Steam account and SteamCMD under a name; pick a profile to switch
all three at once (handy for several projects or a second Steam account).

**Options > Uploading > After uploading** is set per mods folder. Paste a Discord channel's webhook link (channel settings >
Integrations > Webhooks) and each successful update is posted there with its name, version, change note and Workshop
link; **Send test** checks the link. Mentions are switched off, so an `@everyone` in a changelog pings nobody. Tick
**Make a GitHub release** to also create a release with the same notes on the uploaded commit, using the
[gh](https://cli.github.com) tool (run `gh auth login` once; the commit must be pushed). New items are created private,
so they are never announced. The webhook link is a secret, so it is kept in your settings, not in the repo.

Mods that name other Workshop items in their metadata (RimWorld's `modDependencies`, or any
`steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=` link in the marker file) are checked against Steam when the list
loads. A dependency that is private, removed or banned shows as a warning, since subscribers could not get it.

The row tooltip shows each item's subscriber count and how it has changed this week and since the last upload from
this PC. Counts are saved once a day in `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\stats.json`, so the trend fills in over time.

### Command line (scripts and CI)

The same exe uploads without opening the window. It uses the repo, account and SteamCMD picked in the window
unless you pass them, runs the same checks and upload code, and prints a summary at the end.

```powershell
SteamWorkshopUploader upload MyMod OtherMod          # by folder or display name
SteamWorkshopUploader upload --all --dry-run         # check and package every ready mod, upload nothing

SteamWorkshopUploader lint --strict                  # check every mod (About.xml too) without uploading; exit 1 if any is blocked
SteamWorkshopUploader schedule --at "tomorrow 18:00" MyMod   # upload later through Windows Task Scheduler (--list, --cancel 1)
SteamWorkshopUploader help                           # every option
```

- The Steam login must already be saved: log in once from the window (**Options > Account > Log in...**). The command checks
  it once, then uploads each mod in turn.
- A named mod that needs fixing, or does not exist, stops the command before anything is uploaded. `--all` skips
  such mods and says why. `--changed` also skips mods whose version Steam already has, found the same way as the
  window's **Steam version** column (the newest change note on Steam, else this PC's uploads); a mod whose version on
  Steam is not known is uploaded. With nothing to upload it exits `0`, so it can run after every push. New items need `--allow-create`; experimental layouts need `--allow-experimental`.
- After an upload, `--tag` tags each uploaded commit as `<folder>-v<version>` (git packaging only), `--commit-ids`
  commits the Workshop id files of newly created items, and `--announce` posts to the Discord webhook and makes the
  GitHub releases set up for the folder in the window (Options > Uploading > After uploading). These are the steps the window
  offers; a dry run does none of them.
- `--note "..."` uploads every mod with that change note instead of its changelog entry. `--note-from-git` drafts each
  note from the mod's commits since its last upload, like **Draft from git commits** in the window; a mod with no
  such commits keeps its changelog entry.
- `upload --json` prints one JSON object on standard output, whatever happened: `ok`, `exitCode`, `error` (why nothing
  ran), and each mod's `status` (`uploaded`, `created`, `checked`, `failed` or `notrun`), `workshopId`, `message` and
  `tag`. Everything else goes to standard error.
- Exit codes: `0` everything worked, `1` a mod failed or was not run, `2` bad arguments or nothing to upload,
  `3` SteamCMD missing or not logged in.
- SteamCMD runs with `+@ShutdownOnFailedCommand 1 +@NoPromptForPassword 1` whenever nobody can type into it, so an
  expired login or a Steam Guard prompt ends the run with an error instead of leaving a scheduled task or CI job
  waiting until it is killed.
- The app is a Windows program, so in a `cmd` window the prompt comes back before the output finishes. Use
  `start /wait SteamWorkshopUploader upload ...` (or `Start-Process -Wait` in PowerShell) when the next line needs the result,
  or `--log <file>`. Redirected output (CI steps, `> out.txt`) and exit codes work as usual.

### Build step, uploading from a branch, test items and rolling back

**Options > Uploading** has settings for the current mods folder, kept in your settings and never in the repo:

- **Build step**: a command run in the mods folder before anything is packaged (for example `dotnet build -c Release`,
  or a script), for uploads and dry runs alike. If it fails, nothing is uploaded and its output is in the log. The
  command line runs it too (`--no-build` skips it).
- **Upload from**: a git branch or tag to package instead of the checked-out commit, so a `release` branch can go out
  while you work on another. The version and change note are read from that branch. `--ref` does the same on the
  command line.
- **Try again when Steam is busy**: an update that fails because Steam timed out, was busy or could not be reached is
  tried once more after 30 seconds before it counts as failed (on by default; new items are never retried).

**Upload to test items** (next to **Dry run**) sends each ticked mod to its own private copy on Steam instead of the
real item: the first time, a private item titled "<name> (test)" is created and its id saved to
`workshop_id.test.txt` in the mod folder (git-ignore it; it is never packaged). Subscribers of the real item get
nothing, and pending Workshop page changes, the upload history, tags and announcements all wait for the real upload.
Subscribe to the test item in the game to check the build first. `--test` does the same on the command line.

To roll back a bad update, right-click the mod > **Package > Upload history...**, pick an earlier upload and press **Upload this
version again**. In a git repo with git packaging, the app packages the commit that upload came from (its upload tag
when **Tag each upload in git** is on, else the newest commit at that time) and sends it with the old change note
marked as rolled back. Your working folder is not touched; raise the version for the next real update.

### More from SteamCMD

- **One SteamCMD login per batch** (**Options > Uploading**, off by default; `--one-session`): every ticked mod is
  packaged and checked first, then SteamCMD logs in once and uploads them one after another. Without it, each mod gets
  its own SteamCMD run and login. SteamCMD's output is split per mod at each `Success.` or failure line, and each mod
  is still judged on its own (and asked of Steam, like a single upload). A refused login stops the batch as before.
- **Check each upload** (**Options > Uploading**, off by default; `--verify`): after an upload, the item is downloaded
  again with `workshop_download_item`, the way subscribers get it, and its files are compared with what was sent. A
  difference is a warning in the log. Steam can hand out the previous version for a few minutes after an upload.
- **Check what Steam hands out** (right-click a mod > On Steam; `verify <mod>`) does the same at any time, against this PC's last
  upload of the mod.
- **Download from Steam...** (right-click a mod > On Steam; `download <mod|id> --to <folder>`) saves Steam's copy into an empty
  folder, for when the local copy is lost or broken. Unlike rolling back, it does not need git.
- **The account must own the game.** The first time an account uploads for a game, the app reads its licenses with
  `licenses_print` and warns when the game is not among them, since Steam refuses Workshop uploads from accounts that
  don't own it. A game borrowed through Family Sharing does not count. The command line prints the same warning.
- **Game branches** (**Options > SteamCMD**; `game-builds`) lists the game's public build and betas with
  `app_info_print`. At start-up (at most every 12 hours, and only once SteamCMD is installed) the app says in the log
  when the game got a new public build or a beta changed, which is when mods break and supported versions need a bump.
  Turn it off under **Options > SteamCMD**.
- **Try in a game beta...** (right-click a mod > On Steam, or **Options > SteamCMD**; `test-install`) installs a separate copy of
  the game on any branch with `app_update -beta`, into an empty folder (by default under `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\test-installs`).
  With a mod selected, it then puts that mod, packaged as an upload would, and every Workshop item it lists as a
  dependency into the game's mods folder (RimWorld: `Mods`). Start the game's program in that folder to try the mod
  on the next game version; your normal Steam install is not touched. The first install downloads the whole game.
  A beta with a password takes it in the dialog (or `--beta-password`); it is on SteamCMD's command line while it runs.
- **Upload from GitHub Actions** (**Options > Git & GitHub**; `ci-setup`) writes `.github/workflows/steam-workshop-upload.yml`
  into the mods folder. On a Windows runner it downloads SteamCMD and this program, restores SteamCMD's saved login
  from a secret, and runs `upload --changed` whenever a tag starting with `v` is pushed (or from the Actions tab, with a
  dry-run choice). Add two repository secrets: `STEAM_ACCOUNT` (your login name) and `STEAM_CONFIG_VDF`, which
  **Copy login secret...** (or `login-secret`) gives you. That text is SteamCMD's saved login: whoever has it can use
  the login until it expires, so paste it only into the secret, and keep write access to the repo tight. When CI
  uploads start failing with a login error, log in again in the app and update the secret.

### Required items, gallery and other languages

Three more parts of the Workshop page go through the Steam client after an upload, like tags (the client has to be
running as the mod's owner). Each can be turned off under **Options > Uploading**, and right-click > On Steam >
**Update required items, gallery and languages** sends them without uploading.

- **Required items.** The Workshop links in a mod's metadata (RimWorld's `modDependencies` with a `steamWorkshopUrl`)
  become the page's "Required items", so subscribers are offered them. Items the app added are taken off when the mod
  stops listing them; items you added by hand on Steam stay.
- **Gallery.** The layout's `GalleryFolder` (RimWorld: `Gallery` in the mod) holds PNG, JPG and GIF images plus an
  optional `videos.txt` of YouTube links. The page's extra images and videos are made to match it. The folder is never
  packaged.
- **Descriptions in other languages.** A file next to the description file such as `steam_description.german.txt` (or
  `.de.txt`, `.zh.txt` and other short codes) is that language's description; a first line `Title: ...` sets the title.
  Only changed images and translations are sent again.

**Options > Workshop page > Description** has a **footer** for the mods folder: it is added to the end of every
description sent from a description file (with `{name}`, `{id}` and `{game}` filled in), never twice.

**Workshop pages of ticked mods...** (right-click > Ticked mods > Workshop pages, with several mods ticked) finds and replaces text in, or appends a
line to, every ticked mod's description, and sets their visibility, all sent with their next upload.

### Checks, stats and new mods

- **RimWorld checks.** Before upload the list flags a missing or repeated `packageId`, XML in `Defs`, `Patches`,
  `Languages` or `About` that does not parse, `loadFolders.xml` entries pointing at missing folders, version
  folders that `supportedVersions` does not list, `Keyed` translations missing keys English has (or keeping ones it
  dropped), a bundled `0Harmony.dll`, and Harmony used without `brrainz.harmony` in `modDependencies`.
- **Before you confirm** the upload, it says when the git branch is behind its upstream or not pushed, points out
  unclosed BBCode tags in the note or description, and **Preview as on Steam** opens the note as Steam shows it.
- **Dependency updates.** The upload confirmation says when a Workshop item a mod needs was updated since the mod's
  last upload, so you can test against it first.
- **Stats and comments...** (right-click > On Steam) charts subscribers, favourites, views and lifetime subscribers per mod or for
  the whole folder from the daily counts, and shows how many comments are new. Comments are counted through the Steam
  client, on request or at start-up when **Options > Workshop page** says so.
- **New mod** (Ctrl+N, or the empty list) makes a ready-to-upload folder for the layout. For RimWorld: About.xml with a
  packageId, the supported versions, a placeholder preview, the first changelog entry, the description file, and
  optionally a C# project with Harmony that builds into the newest version's `Assemblies` folder.
- **What's new** opens after the app updates itself, with the changes since the version you had (also under
  **Options > About**).
- **Moving to another PC.** **Options > About > Export settings...** saves settings, profiles, per-folder options and
  upload history in one zip; **Import settings...** on the other PC backs up what is there first and asks where each
  mods folder is now. The file can contain Discord webhook links, so keep it private.

### Release helpers

- **Version hint:** the version dialog (F2) marks the bump your commits since the last upload suggest: major for
  `BREAKING CHANGE` or `feat!:`, minor for `feat:` or "Add ...", patch otherwise. The upload confirmation warns when
  the version looks too small for them.
- **Release checklist:** your own steps per mods folder (Options > Uploading), ticked off in the upload confirmation.
  "Don't upload until every step is ticked" makes it a must; dry runs never need it.
- **Mod families:** when picked mods need each other (RimWorld modDependencies, else Workshop links), the ones others
  need go up first, and if one fails, the mods that need it are not uploaded.
- **Package > Make a preview image** draws a title card over a screenshot or a colour; **Workshop description from
  README** turns README.md into Steam BBCode in the description file, with a preview.
- The log notes subscriber milestones (100, 1,000, ...) and a noticeable drop in a week.

### Groups, the command palette and uploading later

- **Groups** (Mods card) saves the ticked mods as a named group for the mods folder and ticks a group again in one
  click. `upload --group <name>` uploads one from the command line.
- **Ctrl+K** (or Ctrl+Shift+P) opens a search over every button, menu item and Options section, with its shortcut.
- **Later...** next to Upload schedules the ticked mods for a time you pick. Windows Task Scheduler runs the command
  line (`upload ... --repo ...`) as you, with the saved Steam login, so the window need not stay open; the PC must be
  on and you signed in, and if it was off it runs as soon as it can. The same window lists and cancels them. Its
  output goes to the past logs.
- **Ticked mods, all at once** (right-click > Ticked mods, with two or more ticked): change their version, or (RimWorld) add a new
  game version to `supportedVersions`, copying the newest version folder and adding it to `loadFolders.xml`.
- A Windows notification says how a run went when the window is in the background (Options > Uploading).

### After uploading: tags, a command and kept packages

- **Push the tags** made by **Tag each upload in git** to the remote straight away (Options > Git & GitHub).
- **Command after uploading** (Options > Uploading, per mods folder) runs after each successful upload, in the mods
  folder, with these environment variables: `SCH_MOD_NAME`, `SCH_MOD_FOLDER`, `SCH_MOD_DIR`, `SCH_VERSION`,
  `SCH_WORKSHOP_ID`, `SCH_WORKSHOP_URL`, `SCH_CREATED`, `SCH_APP_ID`, `SCH_COMMIT` and `SCH_NOTE_FILE` (a file with
  the change note as sent). Like the build step it comes from this PC's settings, never from the repo.
- **Keep a zip of what each upload sent** (Options > Uploading) saves exactly what was sent (the newest 5 per mod); **Uploaded packages**
  on the right-click menu's Package submenu opens the folder.
- **Copy > The mod list as** Markdown, Steam BBCode or CSV, and **Export CSV** in the history window.

### Check setup

**Options > About > Check setup** (or `SteamWorkshopUploader doctor`) checks the mods folder, its layout and app ID, how many
mods need fixing, SteamCMD and the saved login, git and gh when they are used, the Discord link, the Steam client when
tags or required items go through it, the Thunderstore token, free disk space and the data folder, and says what to
fix. The window really logs in with the saved login; on the command line add `--login` for that. Nothing is changed.

### Thunderstore

For BepInEx games (Sun Haven, Valheim, Lethal Company and others), a mod can go to [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io)
as well as Steam. A mod takes part when its folder has Thunderstore's `manifest.json`, a 256 x 256 `icon.png` and a
`README.md`. Under **Options > Uploading > Thunderstore**, set the team, the community (the part after `/c/` in the
site's address, such as `sun-haven`), optional category slugs and a service account token (thunderstore.io > Teams >
Service accounts). Then right-click > **Publish to Thunderstore**, or tick **After each Steam upload** to publish with
every upload.

The package is the same one that goes to Steam, with the version to upload written into the packaged manifest
(`1.2` becomes `1.2.0`; the mod's own file is not changed). What Thunderstore would refuse (the name, version,
description length, icon size or a dependency not written as `Author-Name-1.0.0`) is named before anything is sent,
and a version Thunderstore already has is skipped. The token is kept in your settings encrypted for your Windows user.

### The app in other languages

**Options > Appearance > Language** shows the windows in Deutsch, Русский or 简体中文 from the next start. Log lines and
messages stay in English, and any text a translation leaves out is shown in English. To fix a translation or add a
language, press **Make a translation file...**, fill in the empty texts (keep the `&` before a letter: it marks the
Alt key), and put the file in the folder **Open the languages folder** opens. Open the windows you want covered
first, so their text is in the file. Translations are welcome as pull requests to `Languages/`.

### Which Steam login each feature uses

SteamCMD can log in two ways. **Anonymous** needs no account and can only read public information. Everything that
touches your games or Workshop items needs the **saved login**: the account you type under **Options > Account**,
logged in once in SteamCMD's own window. That account has to own the game.

| What | Login | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upload, create items, test items, roll back | Saved | Steam only takes Workshop changes from the item's owner, who must own the game |
| Check each upload, Check what Steam hands out, Download from Steam | Saved | Steam refuses anonymous Workshop downloads for most games, RimWorld included |
| Try in a game beta (installing the game) | Saved | Installing a game needs an account that owns it |
| The ownership check | Saved | It reads that account's licenses |
| Game branches, the new-build notice | Anonymous | A game's branches and build ids are public |
| Steam version, Updated, subscribers, the game's name | None (Steam's web pages) | Read from public Workshop pages without SteamCMD |
| Workshop tags, required items, gallery, other languages, comment counts | The Steam client | SteamCMD can't set these, so the running Steam client does it as the signed-in account |
| Publish to Thunderstore | Thunderstore token | Thunderstore has its own accounts; Steam is not involved |
| GitHub Actions upload | Saved, copied into a secret | The runner has no one to type a password, so it reuses the saved login |

Because Steam lets an account sign in once at a time, SteamCMD's login takes the Steam client's place when both use
the same account, and the client goes offline. With **Options > Uploading > Bring the Steam client back online** (on
by default), a Steam that was running before the upload is restarted in the tray afterwards and signs back in with its
saved login ("Remember me"). Using a second Steam account for SteamCMD avoids this altogether, but that account must
own the game and be able to update the items.

When you need to log in: the first time you upload, download or install, the app opens SteamCMD's window for your
password and Steam Guard code. Afterwards Steam keeps the login until it expires. When it does (or you change
your password), the next job that needs it says so and offers to log in again. Anonymous jobs never ask.

### Mods not on Steam yet

Tick **Allow creating new items**. They are created private, with the title, description and preview image
from your layout. The new id is saved to the id file; commit it.

## RimWorld tools

Right-click one of your mods > **RimWorld** (RimWorld layouts only):

- **Test in a clean colony:** starts the mod with only the game, the DLC and what it needs, in a "Launch Pad test"
  instance, straight into a test map (`-quicktest`). Close the game and its log is read for errors that point at the
  mod. The upload confirmation warns when the last test had errors or the mod changed since, and when a dependency
  was updated it suggests testing again. **Compatibility grid** shows the last result per supported game version.
- **Play it live:** links the mod's folder into RimWorld's Mods folder (a directory junction), so each build is in
  the game at once. Only links Steam Workshop Uploader made are ever removed; the folder itself is never touched.
- **Edit About.xml:** the common fields with the About.xml checks live, and rules picked from your installed mods.
- **Patch check before upload:** with RimWorld found, the upload confirmation runs the mod's XML with only the game,
  the DLC and its dependencies, and names patches that find nothing and defs it takes over from a dependency. Without
  the game it still flags a def defined twice, a texPath into the mod's own Textures with no texture, and English
  Keyed texts nothing in the mod mentions.
- **Read a player's log:** paste a log or a pastebin/gist/hastebin link and see only the problems in your own mods.

## Custom layouts: `.steamhelper.json`

Only a **Custom** layout is stored in full in the file and can be edited (the file says `"Preset": "Custom"`). Choosing Custom from a built-in layout copies that layout's fields as a starting point. A built-in layout named in the file is always read from the program, whatever else the file says.

The **Generic** layout expects, inside each mod folder: `CHANGELOG.md` (the Workshop change note),
`workshop_id.txt` (the item id, written for you on create), `preview.png` and `steam_description.txt`
(only for creating). Everything is configurable:

| Field | Generic default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AppId` / `GameName` | empty | Steam app id; the name is a label |
| `ModsFolder` | empty | Sub-folder of the repo that holds the mods (empty = repo root) |
| `ModMarker` | empty | File that marks a folder as a mod (e.g. `About/About.xml`, `mod.json`). Empty = every folder |
| `NameKey`, `VersionKey`, `DescriptionKey` | empty | How to read those from the marker file (see below). Empty name = folder name |
| `Changelog` | `CHANGELOG.md` | Release notes file |
| `ChangelogRequired` | true | When false, a missing changelog just sends an empty change note |
| `ChangelogFirstLineIsVersion` | false | Line 1 is the version (warns when it differs from the marker's version) and the rest is the note |
| `ChangelogByVersion` | false | Add Changenote style: one entry per version, and the entry for the current version is required and becomes the note (RimWorld: true) |
| `ManifestFile` | empty | A Mod Manager style manifest whose `<version>` wins over `VersionKey` (RimWorld: `About/Manifest.xml`) |
| `WorkshopIdFile` | `workshop_id.txt` | Stores the Workshop id |
| `WorkshopIdKey` | empty | When set, the id is that key inside `WorkshopIdFile` (read like `NameKey`, e.g. `remote_file_id`), and a new id is written back to it |
| `Preview`, `SteamDescriptionFile` | `preview.png`, `steam_description.txt` | Used when creating (empty `Preview` = none) |
| `BuiltFiles` | `[]` | Build outputs copied from the working tree, e.g. `["Assemblies/*.dll", "*/Assemblies/*.dll"]` (any folder may use `*`; a warning when none match) |
| `RequiredFiles` | `[]` | Files every package must contain, as paths or globs (e.g. `["Assemblies/*.dll"]`). The marker file always counts. A package without one is refused |
| `UseGitArchive` | true | Package with `git archive HEAD` (honours `export-ignore`); false copies the folder using `Exclude` |
| `Exclude` | `.git`, `bin`, `obj`, ... | Skipped when `UseGitArchive` is false |
| `GalleryFolder` | empty | Folder in each mod whose images and `videos.txt` become the Workshop page's gallery; never packaged (RimWorld: `Gallery`) |

How the keys are read depends on the marker file's type:

- `.xml`: an XPath, e.g. `ModMetaData/name`
- `.json`: a dotted path, e.g. `info.title`
- anything else: a key name (`name` matches `name=Foo`, `name = "Foo"`, `name: Foo`), or a regex whose first group is the value

Example for a game whose mods have a `mod.json` and live in `mods/`:

```json
{ "AppId": "123456", "GameName": "My Game", "ModsFolder": "mods", "ModMarker": "mod.json",
  "NameKey": "info.title", "VersionKey": "info.version", "Preview": "" }
```

### Paradox games (experimental)

The **Paradox (descriptor.mod)** layout is for Stellaris (app 281990), Hearts of Iron IV (394360), Europa Universalis IV
(236850), Crusader Kings III (1158310), Crusader Kings II (203770) and Imperator: Rome (859580). Type the game's app ID,
as with Generic. Each mod folder holds a `descriptor.mod`, whose `name` and `version` are shown, and a `thumbnail.png`
preview. The Workshop id is the descriptor's `remote_file_id`; when a new item is created, its id is written back into
that line. There is no changelog convention, so a `CHANGELOG.md` is used when present and is otherwise not required.
Folders with a `descriptor.mod` are detected automatically. The games normally publish through their own launcher, so
try a new private item first.

### Golf With Your Friends (experimental)

The **Golf With Your Friends** layout (app ID 431240) treats each sub-folder as one map: a `Map` file (JSON; the map name and description are read from it), `Preview.jpg` and any `AdditionalN.jpg` screenshots. It is modelled on how a downloaded Workshop map looks on disk, but it is **unproven**: nobody has confirmed the game accepts a hand-uploaded item, and the game writes the item's `publishedID` into the `Map` file itself. Real uploads with it ask for confirmation first. Try a brand-new private item first and check it loads in the game.

### Tabletop Simulator is not supported

Tabletop Simulator (app 286160) does not work with this tool. A Workshop item for it is just a save `.json` and a `.png` thumbnail (its images and models are links to Steam cloud, Google Drive, GitHub and similar, not part of the item), and the game keeps no `steamapps\workshop\content` folder for it. It publishes through its own in-game uploader (Modding > Workshop Upload / Update Workshop), which SteamCMD's content-folder upload does not replace. Use the in-game uploader for TTS mods.

Only RimWorld is tested against real mods; the other presets are starting points. For other games, check the layout with **Dry run** first and
see the game's Workshop documentation for what a mod folder must contain.

## Requests: new games, bugs and features

The **?** button (top right, always visible) offers **Keyboard shortcuts** and **Send a request**, which opens a short form. Pick what the request is: **Support another game** (a layout request), **Report a bug** or **Suggest a feature**. Bugs and features also ask for a one-line summary and what part of the tool they are about (windows, uploading, or SteamCMD and login). For a layout request the form fills in the game name, app ID, your helper version and the file names (never contents) of one mod folder, then opens a pre-filled new issue in **Linear** (team `AZR`) in your browser. Nothing is created until you press Create in Linear, and you can edit or delete anything first. **Copy text instead** copies the text. Only people signed in to the Linear workspace can create the issue, so if you share the program, change `TeamKey` / `NewIssueUrl` in `RequestForm.cs` to your own (or tell people to use **Copy text instead** and send it to you).

### Sending requests from inside the app (maintainer setup)

Builds that carry a Linear key send requests straight from the app, with no browser or login. The key is baked in at build time and never committed:

- **GitHub builds** (CI and releases) read the repository secrets `LINEAR_CREATE_API_KEY` (a Linear personal API key restricted to **Create issues** in one dedicated team) and `LINEAR_TEAM_UUID` (that team's ID).
- **Optional routing:** the secrets `PROJECTID` (a Linear project ID) and `LABELIDS` (label IDs, separated by commas) pick the project and the labels every request gets. `LABELMAP` adds one label for the kind of request and one for the area, as `Name=label ID` pairs separated by commas, using the names `Layout`, `Bug`, `Feature`, `UI`, `Upload` and `SteamCMD` (any left out just add no label). Without these, requests go into the team alone.
- **Local builds** read the same names from a git-ignored `request.key` file in the project folder, one `NAME=value` per line. Environment variables with those names win over the file.

If Linear refuses the project or labels, for example because one was removed, the request is filed into the team alone instead, so it is never lost.

To check the secrets after setting or rotating them, run **Actions > Linear key check > Run workflow**. It files one test request into the project exactly as the app would and fails if the key, team or routing is wrong; delete the test issue afterwards.

The key is stored masked, but anyone with the exe could still extract it. Keep its scope that narrow and revoke it if it is abused. A build without a key opens a pre-filled issue instead; the build log says which (`Linear request key: baked in` or `none found`).

## Safety

- Password and Steam Guard code are typed into SteamCMD's own window, never into this app, and not saved.
- Settings (repo path, account name, theme) live in `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\settings.json`. For portable
  mode, put an empty file named `portable.txt` next to `SteamWorkshopUploader.exe`: settings, history and the default SteamCMD
  then live in a `data` folder beside the exe instead (for a USB stick or a synced folder).
- If the app hits an unexpected error it saves a report to `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\crashes` (the newest 20) and
  offers **Report it**, which opens the request form as a bug report with the details filled in for you to review.
  Nothing is sent unless you press Send.
- Only one window opens at a time, so two copies never run SteamCMD against the same login; starting it again brings
  the open window to the front. The command line is not affected.
- Self-updates are installed only when the download matches the release's SHA-256 checksum and version.
- Profiles and Discord webhook links are kept in the same settings file, not in your repo.
- The upload history lives in `%LocalAppData%\SteamWorkshopUploader\history.json` (the newest 1000 uploads).
- SteamCMD keeps the login cache in its own folder (`config/config.vdf`); keep it out of git. **Copy login secret...**
  and `login-secret` hand that file out (base64) only when you ask, for a GitHub secret.
- The layout file holds no secrets, but it is a new file in your repo: commit it or git-ignore it.
- Uploads publish immediately to subscribers. Use Dry run first when unsure.
- Every package is searched for secrets before upload: Steam's saved login, private keys and key stores, `.env`
  files and tokens with a known shape (GitHub, Discord webhooks, Slack, AWS, Google, Linear, Anthropic) stop it, and
  only the file and line are named, never the value. Leave such files out with the layout's Exclude list or an
  `export-ignore` rule.
- Install SteamCMD only installs a download that arrived whole and whose `steamcmd.exe` is signed by Valve.
- An upload counts as done only when SteamCMD exits cleanly and confirms it with `Success.` (and, for a new item,
  returns its id). Otherwise the row is marked failed and the package is kept in `%TEMP%\steamcmd_helper_*` to inspect.
  After updating an existing public or unlisted item, the app also asks Steam whether the item's "updated" time moved:
  that confirms the update in the log, and it counts a clean run whose `Success.` line went missing as uploaded.
- Headless checks: `SteamWorkshopUploader.exe [--repo <folder>] --selftest out.txt`, `... --package <ModFolder> out.txt`.
  `--shot <folder>` saves screenshots of the main window, each Options section and the request form in both themes.

## Privacy

This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user
or the person installing or operating it. What it does connect to, and why:

- **GitHub** ([privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)):
  at start-up it reads the public list of this project's releases to look for a newer version, and downloads the
  release when you choose to update. Nothing about you or your mods is sent. Turn it off under **Options > About**
  (**Check for a newer version at start-up**). Making a GitHub release for an upload (**Options > Uploading > After uploading**) runs your
  own `gh` tool, only when you turn it on for a mods folder.
- **Steam** ([Valve privacy policy](https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/)): uploads go through Valve's
  SteamCMD, which you sign in to yourself. The app reads public Workshop details and changelog pages for the Workshop ids
  in your mods folder, looks up a game's name from its app ID when you enter one, and downloads SteamCMD from Valve when
  you ask it to install it. Only the Workshop ids and app ID are sent. At start-up, once SteamCMD is installed, it asks
  Steam for the game's public branch list through SteamCMD's anonymous login (at most every 12 hours; turn it off under
  **Options > SteamCMD**).
- **Linear** ([privacy policy](https://linear.app/privacy)): only when you press **Send** in the request form (or
  **Report it** after a crash and then Send). It sends exactly the text shown in the form.
- **Discord** ([privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy)): only when you add a webhook link for a mods folder; after
  an upload it posts the mod's name, Workshop link and change note there.
- **Thunderstore** ([privacy policy](https://thunderstore.io/privacy-policy/)): only when you publish to it; it receives
  the mod's package and your team's token, and the app reads the package's public page to see which version is there.

## Accessibility

Every window is laid out at 100% and scaled to the display's DPI, so it stays readable at 150% and 200% scaling, and
the main window fits the screen it opens on. Inputs carry names for screen readers (taken from their labels), the
progress bars report their percentage, and the Status column's text includes the reason a mod needs attention, not
just its badge.

## Tests

```
dotnet test tests/SteamCmdHelper.Tests
```

The tests compile the non-UI source files directly, so they run on Windows, Linux or macOS.


## Releasing (maintainer)

Run **Actions > Promote test and release > Run workflow** when `test` is ready to ship. It rebases `test` onto `main`,
checks that `<Version>` in `SteamWorkshopUploader.csproj` has a `## <version>` section in `CHANGELOG.md` and no tag yet, runs
the tests, then in one push fast-forwards `main`, tags it `v<version>` and resets `test` to the new `main`. The tag
starts the release below. It never changes the version: bump it on `test` first. Optional inputs: **version** stops the
run if `test` declares a different one, and **dry run** does every check and the tests but pushes nothing. If `test`
does not rebase cleanly, or someone pushes to `test` during the run, nothing is pushed.

Merging a `test` -> `main` pull request instead also works, but with **Automatically delete head branches** turned on
GitHub deletes `test` afterwards. `.github/workflows/keep-test-branch.yml` then recreates it at the new `main`. To stop
the deletion outright, add a ruleset for `test` under **Settings > Rules > Rulesets** with **Restrict deletions** on.

It needs a `RELEASE_TOKEN` secret: a fine-grained personal access token for this repository with **Contents** and
**Workflows** set to read and write. The built-in Actions token cannot push commits that change workflow files, and a
tag it pushes does not start other workflows. If `main` has branch protection or a ruleset, the token's owner must be
allowed to push to it directly.

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag by hand also works. Either way, the tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which tests,
builds, signs (when set up), and publishes the release. After a non-prerelease it also:

- opens a pull request pointing `bucket/steamworkshopuploader.json` (the Scoop manifest) at the new exe and its SHA-256.
  This needs **Settings > Actions > General > Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**.
- sends the new version to winget with `wingetcreate`, once a `WINGET_TOKEN` secret exists (a classic GitHub token
  with `public_repo`). The package must be in [winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) first: submit
  the manifests in `packaging/winget` once by hand (`wingetcreate submit packaging/winget`).

### Code signing (maintainer)

Unsigned exes trip SmartScreen and some antivirus. The release signs the exe, and the app's exe and dll in the
framework-dependent zip, through [SignPath](https://signpath.org) (free for open-source projects) when these are set:

- secret `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` (a SignPath CI user with submitter rights on the project)
- variable `SIGNPATH_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- optional variables `SIGNPATH_PROJECT_SLUG` (default `SteamWorkshopUploader`) and `SIGNPATH_POLICY_SLUG`
  (default `release-signing`)

The SignPath project's artifact configuration is [packaging/signpath/artifact-configuration.xml](packaging/signpath/artifact-configuration.xml):
it signs only files whose product name is `SteamCMD Helper` and whose product version is the release's version, which
the workflow passes in. The project needs the GitHub trusted build system linked to it. Each release waits up to an
hour for the signing request to be approved in SignPath; if nobody approves it, the release run fails and nothing is
published. Without the secret, releases are built unsigned as before.

Releases are not signed yet. SignPath Foundation requires a "Code signing policy" section in this README (who
commits, who approves releases, and the privacy notes above), so add one back when applying; the release notes link to
it once `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` exists.
